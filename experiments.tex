\subsection{Performing State Tomography}

\subsection{Process Tomography of the Quantum Gate}

A quantum process can be described as a map $\mathcal{E} : \rho_\mathcal{H} \to \rho_\mathcal{H}$ that maps a density matrix $\rho$ defined in a Hilbert space $Q_1$ to another density matrix $\mathcal{E}(\rho)$ defined in a target Hilbert space $Q_2$ and fulfilling three axiomatic properties \cite{Nielsen}:

\begin{axiom}
$\mathrm{tr}\left[\mathcal{E}(\rho)\right]$ is the probability that the process represented by $\mathcal{E}$ occurs, when $\rho$ is the initial state.
\end{axiom}

\begin{axiom}
$\mathcal{E}$ is a {\it convex-linear map} on the set of density matrices, that is, for probabilities $\left\{p_i\right\}$,

  \begin{equation}
	  \mathcal{E}\left(\sum\limits_i p_i \rho_i\right) = \sum\limits_i p_i \mathcal{E}(\rho_i)
	\end{equation}
\end{axiom}

\begin{axiom}
$\mathcal{E}$ is a {\it completely-positive} map. That is, if $\mathcal{E}$  maps density operators of system $Q_1$ to density operators of system $Q_2$, then $\mathcal{E}(A)$ must be positive for any positive operator $A$. Furthermore, if we introduce an extra system $R$ of arbitrary dimensionality, it must be true that $(\mathcal{I}\otimes \mathcal{E})(A)$ is positive for any positive operator $A$ on the combined system $RQ_1$, where $\mathcal{I}$ denotes the identity map on system $R$.
\end{axiom}
As shown in \cite{Nielsen}, any quantum process fulfilling these criteria can be written in the form

\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{E}(\rho) = \sum\limits_i E_i \rho E_i^\dagger \label{eq:process_operator_sum_representation}
\end{equation}
for some set of operators $\{ E_i \}$ which map the input Hilbert space to the output Hilbert space, and $\sum_i E_i^\dagger E_i \le I$.

Now, if we express the operators $E_i$ in a different operator basis $\tilde{E}_j$ such that $E_i = \sum_j a_{ij} \tilde{E}_{j}$ and insert into eq. (\ref{eq:process_operator_sum_representation}), we obtain

\begin{eqnarray}
 \mathcal{E}(\rho) & = & \sum\limits_i \sum\limits_j a_{ij} \tilde{E}_j \;\rho\; \sum\limits_k a_{ik}^* \tilde{E}_k^\dagger \\
& = & \sum\limits_{j,k}\tilde{E}_j \; \rho \; \tilde{E}_k^\dagger \sum\limits_i a_{ij} a_{ik}^* \\
& = & \sum\limits_{j,k}\tilde{E}_j \; \rho \; \tilde{E}_k^\dagger \; \chi_{jk} \label{eq:process_chi_representation}
\end{eqnarray}
where we defined $\chi_{jk} = \sum\limits_i a_{ij} a_{ik}^*$. This is the so-called $\chi$-matrix representation of the quantum process. Here, all the information on the process is contained in the $\chi$ matrix, which controls the action of the process-independent operators $\tilde{E}_i$ on the initial density matrix $\rho$.

Now, the goal of {\it quantum process tomography} is to obtain the coefficients of the $\chi$-matrix --or any other complete representation of the process-- from a set of experimentally measured density matrices $\rho$ and $\mathcal{E}(\rho)$.

To achieve this, several techniques have been developed. The technique used in this work is the so-called {\it standard quantum process tomography (SQPT)}. This technique proceeds as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Choose a set of operators $E_i$ that forms a full basis of $\mathcal{M}: Q_1 \to Q_2$. For n-qubit process tomography we usually choose $E_{i_1,i_2 \hdots i_n} = \sigma_{i_1}\otimes \sigma_{i_2}\hdots\otimes\sigma_{i_n}$, where $\sigma_i$ are the single-qubit Pauli operators and $i\in\{I,X,Y,Z\}$. 
\item Choose a set of pure quantum states $\ket{\phi_i}$ such that $\ket{\phi_i}\bra{\phi_i}$ span the whole space of input density matrices $\rho$. Usually, for a n-qubit system we choose $\phi = \{\ket{0},\ket{1},(\ket{0}+\ket{1})/\sqrt{2},(\ket{0}+i\ket{1})/\sqrt{2}\}^{\otimes n}$, where $^{\otimes n}$ denotes the n-dimensional Kronecker product of all possible permutations.
\item For each of the $\ket{\phi_i}$, determine $\mathcal{E}(\ket{\phi_i}\bra{\phi_i})$ by quantum state tomography. Usually we also determine $\ket{\phi_i}\bra{\phi_i}$ experimentally since the preparation of this state already entails small preparation errors that should be taken into account when performing quantum process tomography. 
\end{enumerate}

After having obtained the $\rho_i$ and $\mathcal{E}(\rho_i)$ one obtains the $\chi$-matrix by writing $\mathcal{E}(\rho_i) = \sum_j \lambda_{ij} \tilde{\rho}_j$, with some arbitrary basis $\tilde{\rho}_j$ and
letting $\tilde{E}_m \tilde{\rho}_j \tilde{E}_n^\dagger = \sum_k \beta_{jk}^{mn}\tilde{\rho}_k$. We can then insert into eq. (\ref{eq:process_chi_representation}) and obtain
\begin{eqnarray}
\sum\limits_k \lambda_{ik} \tilde{\rho}_k & = & \sum\limits_{m,n} \chi_{mn} \sum\limits_k \beta_{ik}^{mn} \tilde{\rho}_k  
\end{eqnarray}
This directly yields $\lambda_{ik} = \sum_{m,n}\beta_{ik}^{mn}\; \chi_{mn}$, which, by linear inversion,  gives us $\chi$.
