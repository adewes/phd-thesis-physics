This thesis presents experiments performed with a superconducting two-qubit quantum processor. The main goal of this work was to demonstrate a possible quantum computing architecture based on superconducting  qubits that follows the canonical blueprint of a quantum processor as sketched in fig. \ref{fig:qubit_processor_blueprint}, in accordance with the five criteria formulated by \cite{divincenzo_physical_2000}. By this definition, a universal quantum computer is a register of well-defined quantum bits (1) with long coherence times (2) on which one can implement any unitary evolution using a universal set of quantum  gates (3), fitted with  individual   high fidelity readout   of each qubit (4) and with qubit reset in their ground  state (5).

Implementing this allegedly simple list of requirements in a system of superconducting qubits has been a major research challenge during the last decade.  The observation of  quantum tunneling of a current-biased Josephson junction out of its zero-voltage state by \cite{devoret_measurements_1985,martinis_energy-level_1985}, first  demonstrated  that an electrical variable such as the superconducting phase difference across a Josephson junction can exhibit quantum properties. This phase and the number of Cooper pairs transferred across the junction are conjugated variables that form a single degree of freedom.  The observation of microwave induced transitions between quantum states of the system by \cite{ martinis_energy-level_1985} further confirmed the quantum nature of this  degree of freedom (See also \cite{martinis_energy-level_1985,martinis_experimental_1987,clarke_quantum_1988}). A somewhat simpler quantum electrical circuit called the single Cooper Pair Box was later developed in the Quantronics  group during the 1990s \citep{bouchiat_quantum_1998}\comment{I changed the reference to V. 1998 paper since I didn't find any publication from 1997}. This circuit consists of  a Josephson junction in series with a gate capacitor,  and connected to a voltage source (include figure ? ). \cite{nakamura_coherent_1999} first demonstrated with the Cooper Pair Box the   coherent superposition of two quantum states in an electrical circuit, which was the first superconducting qubit experiment.  Although the achieved coherence time was  quite short, in the 5-10 ns range,  this result attracted a huge interest   and triggered the active development of   research   on superconducting quantum qubits.  
  In the years after Nakamuras experiment, several types of superconducting qubits were proposed using Josephson junctions in different configurations. Different regimes, in which the    quantum state of the junctions  ranges  from almost  number states   to phase states,  were realized.  Let us cite here the flux qubit \citep{mooij_josephson_1999, chiorescu_coherent_2003}.  On the side of Cooper Pair Boxes,  \cite{vion_manipulating_2002} made a significant progress  by operating    a  new   version of the Cooper Pair Box called the {\it Quantronium},  fitted with a strategy for fighting dephasing  due to the noise of the electrical control parameters,  and with single-shot readout (although with limited fidelity). The robustness of the quantronium arises from  its operation at a so-called sweet spot where the qubit  frequency  is stationary respectively to variations of the control parameters. The improved performance of the quantonium allowed to perform all the basic manipulations possible on spins and more generally on  two level systems  \citep{collin_nmr-like_2004}.  Shortly after, another   Cooper pair box design, inspired from cavity QED, was developed at Yale by \cite{wallraff_strong_2004}. In this so-called circuit-QED design, the Cooper Pair Box, embedded in a microwave resonator, can be thought as an artificial atom in a resonant cavity, and the resonator transmission (or reflection)   gives access to the qubit state \citep{blais_cavity_2004}. In this CQED circuit, qubit readout is obtained through the   cavity pull of the resonator frequency controlled by the qubit state, hence its name of dispersive readout method. This small frequency change results in a small phase change of a resonant microwave pulse, which yields after sufficient the probability of the two qubit states.  
Another great bonus of circuit QED is that the electromagnetic environment  in which the qubit  relaxes its energy consists of  a microwave resonator with a controllable impedance.  The modern version of the Cooper Pair Box called {\it Transmon}, follows this design with an extra feature that makes it insensitive to the charge noise that plagues single electron and single Cooper Pair  devices. This feature consists in operating the Cooper Pair Box in the   phase regime by adding an extra capacitance to the   junction one and to  exploit at all orders   the trick exploited.  Being at the sweet spot everywhere,  the qubit frequency is totally insensitive to the gate charge, and hence to the charge noise. This new design, that however still leaves sufficient anharmonicity to operate the device as a qubit and allows to drive it,  yielded a sizeable   improvement in coherence times, qubit robustness and usability. 
Recently, a new type of CQED architecture has been developed by \cite{paik_observation_2011} that combines Transmon qubits with 3D cavities instead of CPW resonators, resulting again in an impressive increase of qubit coherence times of up to two orders of magnitude, with reported qubit relaxation times as high as $80 \; \mu \mathrm{s}$\todo{verify this!} and decoherence times at a comparable time scale. These drastically improved coherence times have already made possible the realization of elemental quantum feedback and error correction schemes with these systems \todo{cite Irfan's paper here}. 

The progress achieved on the Cooper Pair Box during the last decade has benefited to quantum processors, but, the CQED processors operated prior to  this work did not follow the rules established by \cite{divincenzo_physical_2000}.  So far, superconducting CQED processors with up to three qubits have been realized and two- and three-qubit quantum gates \citep{fedorov_implementation_2011}, multi-qubit entanglement \citep{dicarlo_preparation_2010} and simple quantum algorithms \citep{dicarlo_demonstration_2009} as well as quantum error correction recently  \citep{reed_realization_2011} have been demonstrated. These processors were all fitted with joint readout, which allows to measure the average value of a collective variable of the qubit register. By repeating a given sequence of gates a large number of times, one can nevertheless determine the quantum state at that stage of the algorithm being run, and probe it.
Since the whole interest of quantum computing is to perform computational tasks more efficiently than achieved by sequential classical processors, it was nevertheless essential, in our mind, to demonstrate the quantum speed-up expected from quantum algorithms with a CQED quantum processor.

  \smallskip

At the beginning of this thesis work, quantum speed-up of quantum algorithms had been   demonstrated in an electrical quantum processor solely for the Deutsch-Josza algorithm with   a phase qubit processor  using a destructive readout\cite{JohnMartinis2009}. Since the Deutsch-Josza algorithm has no mathematical interest, the demonstration of a  superconducting  quantum processor   approaching more closely  the DiVincenzo criteria, and able to demonstrate quantum speed-up, was an important goal to achieve. The research presented in this thesis  precisely  aims  to complement the CQED architecture by combining a multi-qubit architecture based on Transmon qubits  following the canonical blueprint and able to demonstrate quantum speed-up. 


\smallskip

The first part of the thesis discusses the realization of a superconducting two-qubit processor based on Transmon qubits fitted with individual single-shot readouts. With this processor, we implement elementary one- and two-qubit quantum operations and use it to run a simple quantum algorithm that demonstrates probabilistic quantum speed-up. Finally, we discuss the realization of a four-qubit quantum processor using a more scalable approach that could possibly be extended to an even larger number of qubits.

	\label{fig:two_qubit_processor_schematic}
\end{figure}

The quantum processor implemented in this work is shown in fig. \ref{fig:two_qubit_processor_schematic}. It consists of two superconducting quantum bits of the Transmon type, each equipped with its own drive and readout circuit. In order to obtain  a high fidelity single-shot readout of the qubit register, we used the Josephson Bifurcation Amplifier (JBA) readout method first developed in the team of Michel Devoret at Yale for the quantronium qubit  \citep{siddiqi_rf-driven_2004,vijay_invited_2009}. This method had indeed already been   successfully adapted  to the transmon,  and yielded a 93 \% readout fidelity \citep{mallet_single-shot_2009}. The qubit readout is realized using a nonlinear coplanar-waveguide resonator that serves as a   {\it cavity bifurcation amplifier} (CBA)\citep{siddiqi_dispersive_2006,vijay_invited_2009} and allows a single-shot readout of the qubit state \citep{mallet_single-shot_2009}. Each qubit can be manipulated by driving it with microwave pulses through its readout resonator, allowing for robust and fast single-qubit operations. The qubit frequencies can be tuned individually using fast flux lines, allowing us to change the frequency of each qubit over a range of several GHz. The coupling between the two qubits is realized through a fixed capacitance that connects the two top-electrodes of the Transmons and implements a fixed $\sigma_{xx}$-type qubit-qubit coupling. This coupling allows us to generate entangled two-qubit states and to implement a two-qubit gate. We use this simple processor to generate entangled two-qubit states, test the Bell inequality, implement a  universal two-qubit gate and perform a simple quantum algorithm that demonstrates   quantum speed-up, as will be discussed in the following sections.

\section{Demonstrating Simultaneous Single-Shot Readout}

	\caption[Switching probabilities of the two qubit readouts as a function of the readout excitation power]{a) Switching probabilities of the two qubit readouts as a function of the readout drive power at a fixed driving frequency. The measurement is performed after preparing the qubits in the states $\color{blue}{\ket{0}}$, $\color{red}{\ket{1}}$ and $\color{brown}{\ket{2}}$. The readout contrast is given as the difference in probability between the curves corresponding to the states $\color{blue}{\ket{0}}$ and $\color{red}{\ket{1}}$ or $\color{brown}{\ket{2}}$, respectively. The highest contrasts of 88 and 89 \% are achieved when the qubit is in state $\color{brown}{\ket{2}}$. b) Readout matrix of the two-qubit system. This matrix contains the probabilities to obtain  the different   readout outcomes after having prepared the system in the different   computational basis states.  }
	\label{fig:qubit_readout_characteristics}
\end{figure}

For the readout, each qubit is capacitively coupled   to a coplanar waveguide resonator made  nonlinear by placing a Josephson junction in its central conductor. We exploit the frequency pull of the bifurcation transition that occurs in such a resonator when driven at a suitable frequency and power to map the qubit state on the bifurcation state of the cavity, which is then measured by reflectometry. Here the hysteretic character of the bifurcation transition allows to reduce the power and to determine the bifurcation state without further affecting the qubit.  The state of the resonator can thus be determined reliably  without being limited by qubit relaxation, thereby providing a high-fidelity  single-shot qubit readout. Contrary to previous CQED processors, our processor is fitted   with   individual readout, and a simultaneous readout of the full two-qubit register is possible, as requested by the  DiVincenzo criteria. For single-qubit CBA readouts, readout fidelities up to 93 \% have been reported \citep{mallet_single-shot_2009}. However, due to the higher complexity and design constraints of our system, only  83-89 \% fidelity has been achieved for the processor presented here. The full characterization of the readout of our processor is shown in fig. \ref{fig:qubit_readout_characteristics}. Fig. \ref{fig:qubit_readout_characteristics}a shows the switching probabilities of each individual qubit readout as a function of the drive amplitude, measured at a fixed drive frequency. Individual curves correspond to the qubit being prepared in different states $\ket{0}$, $\ket{1}$ or $\ket{2}$, the difference between either two curves giving the readout contrast between those qubit states. Preparing the qubit in state $\ket{2}$ before readout can increase the readout fidelity by more than 10 \% and is therefore often used in the experiments presented in this thesis. Fig. \ref{fig:qubit_readout_characteristics}b shows the full readout matrix of the two-qubit register that relates measured readout switching probabilities with real qubit state occupation probabilities and allows us to correct readout errors when performing quantum state tomography. In the main text of this thesis we discuss all relevant readout fidelities and errors in detail and analyze different error sources limiting the readout performance in our experiments.

\section{Generating and Characterizing Entanglement}

	\label{fig:swap_interaction_state_tomography}
\end{figure}

The capacitive coupling between the two qubits provides a $\sigma_{xx}$-type interaction that can be used to generate entangled two-qubit states. Conveniently, this coupling is only effective when the qubit frequencies are near-resonant and can therefore be effectively switched on and off by tuning the qubit frequencies in and out of resonance. For the processor realized in this work, the effective coupling constant $g$ of the two qubits has been measured as $2g/2\pi = 8.2 \; \mathrm{MHz}$. When the two qubits are in resonance, the effective evolution operator of the two-qubit system is:

\begin{equation}
	U(t)  =  \left( \begin{array}{cccc} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \cos{2 \pi t g} & i\sin{2 \pi t g} & 0 \\ 0 & i\sin{2 \pi t g} & \cos{2 \pi t g} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{array} \right) \label{eq:swap_evolution_operator}
\end{equation}
 where $U(t)$ is written in the basis $\{\ket{00},\ket{01},\ket{10},\ket{11}\}$. By using fast flux pulses to non-adiabatically tune the qubits in and out of resonance we can switch on this interaction for a well-defined time. We first characterize the effect of the coupling on the qubit register by preparing the state $\ket{10}$, tuning the qubits in resonance for a given time and measuring the  qubit state afterwards. The resulting curve is shown in fig. \ref{fig:swap_interaction_state_tomography} and   shows swapping  oscillations between the two qubits. Analyzing this curve allows us to extract the effective coupling strength between the qubits. Leaving the interaction between the qubits on for a well-defined time allows us to generate entangled Bell states that we characterize by performing quantum state tomography. The experimental reconstruction of the density matrix of such a Bell-state of the type $\ket{\psi} = 1/\sqrt{2}(\ket{01}+i\ket{10})$ is shown in fig. \ref{fig:swap_interaction_state_tomography}b. The measured fidelity of the prepared state of 91 \% and the concurrence of 85 \% confirm that entanglement is present in the system. We also characterize the entanglement between the two qubits by measuring the so-called {\it Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt} operator \citep{clauser_proposed_1969}, which combines measurements of the state of the two qubits along different axes on the Bloch sphere and provides a test that can distinguish between classical correlation and quantum entanglement in a two-qubit system.

\begin{figure}[ht!]

		\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{./material/papers/iswap/submission1/Dewes_Figure3}
	\caption[Measurement of the CHSH operator of an entanged two-qubit state]{Measurement of the CHSH operator for an entangled two-qubit state.

The inset shows the standard deviation $\sigma$ at the highest point of the curve as a function of the measurement sample size. For the highest sample count, the classical boundary is exceeded by $22$ standard deviations.}
	\label{fig:chsh_measurement}
\end{figure}

For classical states, the maximum value of the $\mathrm{CHSH}$ operator is bound by $2$ but for entangled states it can reach a maximum of $2\sqrt{2}$. Fig. \ref{fig:chsh_measurement} shows the result of such a $\mathrm{CHSH}$-type measurement performed on a state created by the method described above, showing the value of $\bracket{\mathrm{CHSH}}$ as a function of the angle $\phi$ of the measurement basis (more details about the measurement and the preparation of the entangled state can be found in the main text). We observe a violation of the classical boundary $2$ of the operator by $22$ standard deviations when correcting the readout errors that are present in our system. The raw, uncorrected data fails to exceed the classical threshold because of readout errors mainly caused by qubit relaxation during the readout. Nevertheless, the observed violation of the equation in the calibrated data is a strong indication of entanglement in the system.

\section{Realizing a Universal Two-Qubit Quantum Gate}

\begin{SCfigure}[][htb!]
		\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{./material/papers/iswap/figures/chi_matrix}
	\caption[Measured $\chi$-matrix of the $\sqrt{i\textrm{SWAP}}$ gate]{The measured $\chi$-matrix of the implemented $\sqrt{i\mathrm{SWAP}}$ gate. The row labels correspond to the indices of the $E_i$ operators, the height of each bar to the absolute value of the corresponding matrix element and the color and direction of the red arrow to the complex phase of each element. The ideal $\chi$-matrix of the $i\sqrt{\mathrm{SWAP}}$ gate is given by the outlined bars. The upper half of the positive-hermitian matrix is not shown.}
	\label{fig:gate_chi_matrix_and_errors}
\end{SCfigure}

The swapping evolution given by eq. (\ref{eq:swap_evolution_operator}) allows not only to prepare entangled two-qubit states but also to implement of a two-qubit universal gate. When switching on the interaction for a time $t_{\pi/2} = 1/8g$ one realizes the so-called $\sqrt{i\mathrm{SWAP}}$ gate, which has the representation

\begin{equation}
	U(t)  =  \left( \begin{array}{cccc} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1/\sqrt{2} & i\sqrt{2} & 0 \\ 0 & i\sqrt{2} & 1/\sqrt{2} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{array} \right) \label{eq:sqrt_iswap_gate}
\end{equation}

and is a universal two-qubit quantum gate. We characterize the operation and errors of our implementation of this gate by performing quantum process tomography, obtaining a gate fidelity of 90 \%\ . The 10 \% error in gate fidelity is caused mainly by qubit relaxation and dephasing during the gate operation and only marginally by deterministic preparation errors, as will be discussed in the main text of the thesis. Fig. \ref{fig:gate_chi_matrix_and_errors} shows the measured $\chi$ matrix of the gate, that describes its effect in the Pauli basis of two-qubit operators. The $\chi$  matrix  provides  the full information on the unitary and non-unitary action of the gate. The achieved fidelity of the gate operation is sufficient to allow the implementation of   simple quantum algorithms with our processor.
 
\section{Running a Quantum Search Algorithm}

\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./material/papers/grover/figures/grover_algorithm_schematic}
	\caption[implementation of the Grover search algorithm]{Implementation of the Grover search algorithm on our two-qubit quantum processor. The algorithm consists in preparing a fully superposed state, applying a given Oracle operator to it, and analyzing the resulting output to determine the quantum state tagged by this Oracle operator with only a single call.} 
	\label{fig:grover_algorithm_schematic}
\end{figure}

The implementation  uses a two-qubit quantum gate related to the one described above to run a simple quantum algorithm on our processor, the so called {\it Grover search algorithm} \citep{Grover_Quantum_1997}. The version of this algorithm that we implemented operates on a two-qubit basis $x_i \in \{$ $\ket{00}$ , $\ket{01}$, $\ket{10}$ , $\ket{11}\}$ and can distinguish between four different {\it Oracle functions} $f(x)$ with $x \in x_i$ that each tag one given basis state $x_j$. In the two-qubit case, this algorithm requires only one evaluation of the Oracle function $f(x)$, which is now an operator,  to determine which state among the four possible ones it  tags. This case thus provides a simple    benchmark of   the operation of the quantum processor, and a simple and illustrative example of  quantum  speed-up  in comparison      with  classical algorithms (although there are some subtleties, as discussed in the main text). The diagram of the   Grover search algorithm implemented in our processor is shown in fig. \ref{fig:grover_algorithm_schematic} and involves two $i\mathrm{SWAP}$ gate operations and six single-qubit operations along with a single-shot qubit readout at the end of the algorithm. We measured the success probability of the algorithm from   the obtained outcomes, and completed the analysis of its operation by performing the   tomography of the quantum state at different steps of the algorithm. We first discuss this evolution  that sheds light on how  quantum speed-up is achieved.  

\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=1.\textwidth]{./material/figures/2-qubit-processor/grover/grover-density-matrices-state-1}
	\caption[Measured density matrices when running the Grover algorithm]{Measured density matrices when running the Grover search algorithm with a search oracle marking the state $\ket{00}$. 1) shows the state after the generalized Hadamard transform, 2) after applying the quantum oracle and 3) after the final step of the algorithm.} 
	\label{fig:grover_density_matrices_state_1}
\end{figure}

Fig. \ref{fig:grover_density_matrices_state_1} shows the density matrices determined experimentally when running the Grover search  algorithm with the Oracle operator that tags the state $\ket{00}$. State tomography is   first shown after preparation with a generalized Hadamard transform applied to the initial state $\ket{00}$. It clearly corresponds then to the superposition of all the computational basis states, as often done in quantum algorithms.  The quantum state after  the quantum Oracle is more subtle since the information on the tagged state is encoded in the phase of tha matrix elements involving $\ket{00}$ once only. At the end of the algorithm,  the tomography displays a large peak on state  $\ket{00}$ , as expected.  The fidelity of the final quantum state of the algorithm is  $68 \%$, $61 \%$, $64 \%$ and $65 \%$  for the four different Oracle operators, respectively. These fidelities, corrected for readout errors,   do not quantify the quantum speed-up   achieved when running the algorithm. For this, it is necessary to analyze the uncorrected single-shot readout outcomes. 

\section{Demonstrating Quantum Speed-Up}

\begin{figure}[ht!]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{"./data/ct5/2011_04_21 - grover and tomo/good_data/grover algorithm - single run probabilities"}
	\caption[Single-run results of the Grover search algorithm]{Single-run results when running the Grover search algorithm on our two-qubit quantum processor. Shown are the probabilities of obtaining the results $00,01,10,11$ as a function of the Oracle function provided to the algorithm, indicated by the number on top of each graph. In all four cases, the success probability of the algorithm is $> 50 \%$, thus outperforming any classical query-and-guess algorithm in the required number of calls to the Oracle function.}
	\label{fig:grover_single_shot_probabilities}
\end{figure}

The main interest of running a quantum algorithm is to obtain an advantage in the run-time in comparision to a classical algorithm, the so-called {\it quantum speed-up}. To characterize this quantum speed-up as obtained with our processor, we run the Grover algorithm for all four possible Oracle functions and directly read out the state of the qubit register after the last step of the algorithm instead of performing quantum state tomography, thus not correcting any readout errors. By averaging the outcomes of many such individual runs of the algorithm with different Oracle functions we obtain the so-called {\it single-run fidelities}, which --for the four different Oracle functions-- have been measured as $66 \%$, $55\%$, $61\%$ and $52\%$. The full probability distributions for the four possible cases and are shown in fig. \ref{fig:grover_single_shot_probabilities}. The achieved success probability is  always lower than the theoretically possible value  of 100 \% ,  mainly because of relaxation and decoherence of the qubit state during the runtime of the algorithm, and also of errors in the pulse sequence, but to a small degree. The measured success probabilities are however larger than the $> 50 \%$ success probability of a classical query-and-guess algorithm using the outcome of a single query, which  demonstrates the   quantum speed-up achieved with our processor, as explained in greater detail in the main text. Indeed, a   random query-and-guess   allows either to find the searched state, or to rule out one, which  yields to guess  the correct answer with $> 50 \%$ probability instead of  with $> 25 \%$ for a random guess-and-check. However, since the gain obtained from a query-and-guess  algorithm is not scalable, the comparison with the $> 25 \%$ guess-and-check success probability is more relevant.
