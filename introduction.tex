This thesis presents experiments performed on on superconducting 2-Qubit quantum processor. The main goal of this work was to demonstrate a possible quantum computing architecture using superconducting qubits that follows the canonical blueprint of a 2-qubit quantum processor as formulated by \cite{divincenzo_physical_2000} and as shown in fig. \ref{fig:Grover1}. In this respect, a universal quantum computer is a register of quantum bits -- or qubits -- on which one can perform universal 1- and 2-qubit quantum gates. In addition, one can read out the state of each qubit individually and with high fidelity and reset the qubit register to a well-defined product state.

Implementing this allegedly simple list of requirements in a system of superconducting qubits has been a major research challenge during the last decade. The first demonstration of coherent quantum-mechanical dynamics in a superconducting structure by \cite{nakamura_coherent_1999} sparked a broad research field about superconducting quantum bits. In the years following Nakamura's discovery, several types of superconducting qubits were proposed and realized, using the superconducting phase \citep{martinis_energy-level_1985,martinis_rabi_2002} across a Josephson junction or the magnetic flux \citep{mooij_josephson_1999,chiorescu_coherent_2003} in a superconducting ring as the dominant quantum variable. Another milestone was the development of the so called {\it Quantronium} qubit \citep{vion_manipulating_2002}, which showed for the first time a coherence time larger than 1 $\mu s$ by using an intermediate regime between charge and phase qubits and operating the device at a sweetspot. This also made it possible to perform -- for the first time -- robust, high fidelity single-qubit operations with a superconducting qubit. In 2004, the development of a new type of qubit, the so called {\it Transmon} \citep{wallraff_strong_2004} drastically improved the quality of superconducting charge qubits by operating them deep in the phase regime and by embedding them in superconducting coplanar waveguide resonators, which allows for an easy and robust readout and yields a high qubit lifetime. Within this approach, quantum gates and algorithms with up to four qubits have been implemented, demonstrating multi-qubit entanglement \citep{dicarlo_preparation_2010} and simple quantum algorithms \citep{dicarlo_demonstration_2009}.

In parallel to this, the development of quantum-limited amplifiers based on non-linear superconducting resonators by \cite{siddiqi_rf-driven_2004} complemented the CQED architecture by providing a fast and high-fidelity readout scheme for Transmon qubits \citep{siddiqi_dispersive_2006,mallet_single-shot_2009} and for the amplification of quantum signals in general. This opened up the road to the direct observation of quantum jumps in superconducting qubits \citep{vijay_observation_2011} and even for implementing simple forms of quantum feedback. \todo{Add reference to quantum feedback paper as soon as it appears}

Another important recent breakthrough is the development of a qubit architecture using three-dimensional superconducting cavitities instead of one-dimensional coplanar waveguide resonators in the CQED approach \cite{paik_observation_2011}. Producing an increase in qubit lifetime of one order of magnitude, this technique opened the road to more complex quantum feedback and error correction experiments.

This work wants to fit in this global picture by complementing the CQED approach with a single-shot, individual qubit readout. Such a readout is absolutely necessary when pursuing the long-term goal of a superconducting quantum computer but -up to now- was just not provided by ``classical'' CQED.
