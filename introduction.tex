This thesis presents experiments performed with a superconducting two-qubit quantum processor. The main goal of this work was to demonstrate a possible quantum computing architecture based on superconducting qubits that follows the canonical blueprint of a quantum processor as shown in fig. \ref{fig:qubit_processor_blueprint}, in accordance with the five criteria formulated by \cite{divincenzo_physical_2000}. By this definition, a universal quantum computer is 1.) a register of well-defined quantum bits -- or qubits -- 2.) with long coherence times on which one can 3) perform universal single- and two-qubit quantum gates, 4.) read out the state of each qubit individually and with high fidelity and 5.) reset the qubit register to a well-defined state.

Implementing this allegedly simple list of requirements in a system of superconducting qubits has been a major research challenge during the last decade. The first demonstration of coherent quantum-mechanical behaviour in a superconducting device was achieved by \cite{nakamura_coherent_1999} and opened up a broad research field on superconducting quantum bits. In the years following Nakamuras initial experiment, several types of superconducting qubits were proposed and realized using e.g. the superconducting phase across a Josephson junction \citep{martinis_energy-level_1985,martinis_rabi_2002} or the magnetic flux inside a superconducting ring interrupted by one or several Josephson junctions \citep{mooij_josephson_1999,chiorescu_coherent_2003} as the dominant quantum variable. An important result on the way to robust superconducting qubits was the development of the so-called {\it Quantronium} qubit by \cite{vion_manipulating_2002}. The Quantronium is a Cooper pair box with comparable Josephson and charging energies operated at a well-defined ``sweet spot'' at which the sensitivity of the device to charge and flux noise is greatly reduced. The high coherence times achieved with the Quantronium --values larger than 2 $\mu s$ have been reported-- allowed for the first time the implementation of NMR-like quantum operations using a superconducting qubit \citep{collin_nmr-like_2004}. In 2004, the development of a new type of qubit, the so called {\it Transmon}, by \cite{wallraff_strong_2004} marked again a drastic improvement in coherence times, qubit robustness and usability. The Transmon qubit is a Cooper pair box shunted with a large capacitor that drastically decreases the charging energy of the system and thus renders the device almost insensitive to charge noise but still leaves it sufficiently anharmonic to act as a qubit. With the Transmon, coherence times comparable or higher than those reported for the Quantronium have been achieved, {\it without} operating the qubit at a special working point, thereby greatly reducing experimental complexity. Furthermore, by embedding the Transmon qubit in a superconducting coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonator it is possible to protect it from external sources of electrical noise and to use the dispersive interaction between the qubit and the resonator for reading out the qubit state \citep{blais_cavity_2004}. This approach of embedding a superconducting qubit in a waveguide resonator has been termed --in analogy with conventional quantum electrodynamics-- {\it circuit quantum electrodyanmics} (CQED) and has gained wide popularity in the superconducting qubit community \todo{add some citations of relevant experiments}. So far, using this CQED approach, superconducting quantum processors with up to three qubits have been realized and two- and three-qubit quantum gates\todo{references}, multi-qubit entanglement \citep{dicarlo_preparation_2010} and simple quantum algorithms \citep{dicarlo_demonstration_2009} have been demonstrated.\comment{Mention Martinis experiments with phase qubits?}

Recently, a new type of CQED architecture has been developed by \cite{paik_observation_2011} that combines Transmon qubits with 3D cavities instead of CPW resonators, resulting again in an impressive increase of qubit coherence times of up to two orders of magnitude, with reported qubit relaxation times as high as $80 \; \mu \mathrm{s}$\todo{verify this!} and decoherence times at a comparable time scale. These drastically improved coherence times have already made possible the realization of elemental quantum feedback and error correction schemes with these systems \todo{cite Irfan's paper here} and make them promising candidates for the realization of a superconducting quantum computer.\todo{expand this section as soon as new relevant material appears, include recent IBM, Yale}

In parallel to this, the development of quantum-limited amplifiers based on nonlinear superconducting resonators by \question{Should I mention Michel here?}I. Siddiqi \citep{siddiqi_rf-driven_2004,vijay_invited_2009} provided a very useful tool for measuring weak quantum signals, making possible the realization of high-fidelity readout scheme for Transmon qubits \citep{siddiqi_dispersive_2006,mallet_single-shot_2009}. Superconducting quantum-limited amplifiers and detectors also have played a key role in the observation of quantum jumps in a superconducting qubit \citep{vijay_observation_2011} and in the implementation of simple quantum feedback schemes with superconducting circuits\todo{Add reference to quantum feedback paper as soon as it appears}.

\smallskip

With the research presented in this thesis we aim \comment{can I really say ``we'' here or should it be ``I''?} to complement the CQED architecture as outlined in the last sections by combining a multi-qubit architecture based on Transmon qubits with a readout scheme based on quantum-limited detectors, thus providing the so-far missing per-qubit single-shot readout that would be needed to realize a canonical superconducting quantum processor with these devices.

The first part of the thesis discusses the realization of a superconducting two-qubit processor based on Transmon qubits fitted with individual-qubit, single-shot readouts. With this processor, we implement elementary one- and two-qubit quantum operations and use it to run a simple quantum algorithm that demonstrates probabilistic quantum speed-up. Finally, we discuss the realization of a four-qubit quantum processor using a more scalable approach that could possibly be extended to an even larger number of qubits.

Each qubit is embedded in its own nonlinear readout resonator and can be driven and read out through an individual microwave line.}
	\label{fig:two_qubit_processor_schematic}
\end{figure}

The quantum processor implemented in this work is shown in fig. \ref{fig:two_qubit_processor_schematic}. It consists of two superconducting quantum bits of the Transmon-type, each equipped with its own drive and readout circuit. The qubit readout is realized using a nonlinear coplanar-waveguide resonator that serves as a {\it cavity bifurcation amplifier} (CBA)\citep{siddiqi_dispersive_2006,mallet_single-shot_2009,vijay_invited_2009} and allows a single-shot readout of the qubit state. Each qubit can be manipulated by driving it with microwave pulses through its readout resonator, allowing for robust and fast single-qubit operations. The qubit frequencies can be tuned individually using fast flux lines, allowing us to change the frequency of each qubit over a range of several GHz. The coupling between the two qubits is realized through a fixed capacitance that connects the two top-electrodes of the qubits and implements a fixed $\sigma_{xx}$-type qubit-qubit coupling. This coupling allows us to generate entangled two-qubit states and to implement a two-qubit gate. We use this simple processor to generate entangled two-qubit states, test the Bell inequality, implement an universal two-qubit gate and perform a simple quantum algorithm that demonstrates probabilistic quantum speed-up, as will be discussed in the following sections.

\section{Demonstrating Simultaneous Single-Shot Readout}

\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=1.\textwidth]{./material/papers/grover/figures/simultaneous_readout_characteristics}
	\caption[Switching probabilities of the two qubit readouts as a function of the readout excitation power]{a) Switching probabilities of the two qubit readouts as a function of the readout drive power at a fixed driving frequency. The measurement is performed after preparing the qubits in the states $\color{blue}{\ket{0}}$, $\color{red}{\ket{1}}$ and $\color{brown}{\ket{2}}$. The readout contrast is given as the difference in probability between the curves corresponding to the states $\color{blue}{\ket{0}}$ and $\color{red}{\ket{1}}$ or $\color{brown}{\ket{2}}$, respectively. The highest contrasts of 88 and 89 \% are achieved when the qubit is in state $\color{brown}{\ket{2}}$. b) Readout matrix of the two-qubit system. The matrix contains the probabilities of obtaining a given measurement result after having prepared the system in a given state. \figcomment{Replace this figure since it is not very intuitive. It would be better to show something which allows the reader to directly quantify the visibility and readout crosstalk present in the system.}}
	\label{fig:qubit_readout_characteristics}
\end{figure}

To read out the state of each qubit we use a so called {\it cavity bifurcation amplifier} (CBA). For this readout technique, we capacitively couple the qubit to a coplanar waveguide resonator that is rendered nonlinear by placing a Josephson junction in its center conductor. The capacitive coupling between the qubit and the resonator creates a dispersive interaction between them that induces a change of the resonance frequency of the resonator dependent on the state of the qubit, and vice versa. Furthermore, the resonator can exhibit bistability at certain drive parameters due to its nonlinearity. Therefore, by driving it at a carefully chosen frequency and drive amplitude we can use the dispersive qubit-resonator interaction to map the state of the qubit to one of the bistable states of the resonator. We can then stabilize this resonator state by changing its operating point, effectively decoupling it from the further evolution of the qubit state. This allows us to measure the state of the resonator with high precision without being limited by qubit relaxation, thereby providing a high-fidelity, single-shot qubit readout. Contrary to other CQED approaches, in our setup each individual qubit is fitted with such a CBA readout, allowing hence a simultaneous readout of the full two-qubit register and following the canonical blueprint of a quantum computer as formulated by DiVincenzo. For single-qubit CBA readouts, readout fidelities up to 93 \% have been reported \citep{mallet_single-shot_2009}. However, due to the higher complexity and design contraints of our system, only  83-89 \% fidelity have been achieved for the processor presented here. The full characterization of the readout of our processor is shown in fig. \ref{fig:qubit_readout_characteristics}. Fig. \ref{fig:qubit_readout_characteristics}a shows the switching probabilities of each individual qubit readout as a function of the drive amplitude, measured at a fixed drive frequency. Individual curves correspond to the qubit being prepared in different states $\ket{0}$, $\ket{1}$ or $\ket{2}$, the difference between either two curves giving the readout contrast between those qubit states. Preparing the qubit in state $\ket{2}$ before readout can increase the readout fidelity by more than 10 \% and is therefore often used in the experiments presented in this thesis. Fig. \ref{fig:qubit_readout_characteristics}b shows the full readout matrix of the two-qubit register that relates measured readout switching probabilities with real qubit state occupation probabilities and allows us to correct readout errors when performing quantum state tomography.

\section{Generating and Characterizing Entanglement}

The black circles correspond to the density matrices of the ideal states $\ket{10}$ and $1/\sqrt{2}/(\ket{10}+i\ket{01})$, respectively.\figcomment{verify sign!}}
	\label{fig:swap_interaction_state_tomography}
\end{figure}

The capacitive coupling between the two qubits provides a $\sigma_{xx}$-type interaction that can be used to generate entangled two-qubit states. Conveniently, this coupling is only effective when the qubit frequencies are near-resonant and can therefore be effectively switched on and off by tuning the qubit frequencies in and out of resonance. For the processor realized in this work, the effective coupling constant $g$ of the two qubits has been measured as $2g = 8.2 \; \mathrm{MHz}$. When the two qubits are in resonance the effective Hamiltonian of the two-qubit system can be written as

\begin{equation}
	U(t)  =  \left( \begin{array}{cccc} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \cos{2 \pi t g} & i\sin{2 \pi t g} & 0 \\ 0 & i\sin{2 \pi t g} & \cos{2 \pi t g} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{array} \right) \label{eq:swap_evolution_operator}
\end{equation}

%explain that we stop the evolution at the right time to generate entangled states and implement a Two-qubit gate.

By using fast flux pulses to non-adiabatically tune the qubits in and out of resonance we can switch on this interaction for a well-defined time. We can characterize its action on the qubit register by preparing the state $\ket{10}$, tuning the qubits in resonance for a given time and measuring the  qubit state afterwards. The resulting curve is shown in fig. \ref{fig:swap_interaction_state_tomography} and clearly shows energy oscillations between the two qubits. Stopping the interaction after quarter of a  period of these osciallations allows us to generate entangled Bell states that we can characterize by  e.g. performing quantum state tomography. The experimental reconstruction of the density matrix of such a state corresponding to the Bell-state $\ket{\psi} = 1/\sqrt{2}(\ket{01}+i\ket{10})$ is shown in fig. \ref{fig:swap_interaction_state_tomography}b. The measured fidelity of the prepared state of 91 \% and the concurrence of 85 \% confirm that entanglement is present in the system. This entanglement can also be characterized by measuring the so-called {\it Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt} operator \citep{clauser_proposed_1969}, which is given as

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{CHSH} = \mathrm{QS}+\mathrm{RS}+\mathrm{RT}-\mathrm{QT}
\end{equation}
with the operators $\mathrm{Q,R,S,T}$ being defined as

\begin{eqnarray}
	\begin{array}{cccccccc}
		\mathrm{Q} & = & \sigma_z^1 &&& \mathrm{S} & = & \sigma_z^2\cdot \cos{\phi}+\sigma_x^2 \cdot \sin{\phi} \\
		\mathrm{R} & = & \sigma_x^1 &&& \mathrm{T} & = & -\sigma_z^2\cdot \sin{\phi}+\sigma_x^2 \cdot \cos{\phi}
	\end{array}
\end{eqnarray} 
Here, the angle $\phi$ is a parameter that should be chosen in accordance to the phase of the Bell state on which it is applied.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{./material/papers/iswap/submission1/Dewes_Figure3}
	\caption[Measurement of the CHSH operator of an entanged two-qubit state]{Measurement of the CHSH operator for an entangled two-qubit state. The renormalized CHSH expectation value (red points) exceeds the classical boundary of $2$ by a large amount. The raw measurement data (blue points) lies below this critical threshold. The inset shows the standard deviation $\sigma$ at the highest point of the curve as a function of the measurement sample size. For the highest sample count, the classical boundary is exceeded by $22$ standard deviations.\figcomment{p. 140 in cavities 6 labbook}}
	\label{fig:chsh_measurement}
\end{figure}

The expectation value $\bracket{CHSH}$ provides a test of the quantum-mechanical character of the generated state. For classical states, the maximum value is bound by $2$ but for entangled states it can reach a maximum of $\sqrt{2}\cdot 2$. Fig. \ref{fig:chsh_measurement} shows the result of such a CHSH-type measurement performed on a state created by the method described above, showing the value of $\bracket{CHSH}$ as a function of the angle $\phi$ of the measurement basis. We observe a violation of the classical boundary $2$ of the operator by $22$ standard deviations when correcting the readout errors that are present in our system. The raw, uncorrected data fails to exceed the non-classical bound, making it impossible to close the detection loophole with our experiment. Nevertheless, the observed violation of the equation by the renormalized state is a strong indication of entanglement in the system.

\section{Realizing a Universal Two-Qubit Quantum Gate}

The ideal $\chi$-matrix of the $i\sqrt{\mathrm{SWAP}}$ gate is given by the outlined bars. The upper half of the positive-hermitian matrix is not shown.}
	\label{fig:gate_chi_matrix_and_errors}
\end{SCfigure}

The swapping evolution given by eq. (\ref{eq:swap_evolution_operator}) allows not only the preparation of entangled two-qubit states but also the implementation of a two-qubit gate. When switching on the interaction for a time $t_{\pi/2} = 1/8g$ we can realize the so-called $\sqrt{i\mathrm{SWAP}}$ gate, which has the representation

\begin{equation}
	\sqrt{i\mathrm{SWAP}}  =  \left( \begin{array}{cccc} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1/\sqrt{2} & i/\sqrt{2} & 0 \\ 0 & i/\sqrt{2} & 1/\sqrt{2} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{array} \right) \label{eq:sqrt_iswap_gate}
\end{equation}
and is a universal two-qubit quantum gate. We characterize the operation and errors of our implementation of this gate by performing quantum process tomography, obtaining a gate fidelity of 90 \%\ . The 10 \% error in gate fidelity is caused mainly by qubit relaxation and dephasing during the gate operation and only marginally by deterministic preparation errors, as will be discussed in the main text of the thesis. Fig. \ref{fig:gate_chi_matrix_and_errors} show the measured $\chi$ matrix of the gate, which contains the full information on the quantum process describing the gate. The achieved fidelity of the gate operation is sufficient to allow the implementation of a simple quantum algorithm with our processor, as will be discussed in the following section.
 
\section{Running a Quantum Search Algorithm}

\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./material/papers/grover/figures/grover_algorithm_schematic}
	\caption[Schematic of the implementation of the Grover search algorithm]{Schematic of the implementation of Grovers search algorithm on a two-qubit quantum processor. The algorithm consists in preparing a fully superposed state, applying the quantum oracle to this state and analyzing the resulting output state to determine the Oracle operator that has been applied to the state.} 
	\label{fig:grover_algorithm_schematic}
\end{figure}

We can use the two-qubit quantum gate described above to run a simple quantum algorithm on our processor, the so called {\it Grover search algorithm} \citep{Grover_Quantum_1997}. The version of this algorithm that we implemented operates on a two-qubit basis $x_i \in \{$ $\ket{00}$ , $\ket{01}$, $\ket{10}$ , $\ket{11}\}$ and can distinguish between four different {\it Oracle functions} $f(x)$ with $x \in x_i$ that each tag one given basis state $x_j$. The Grover algorithm for two qubits requires only one evaluation of the function $f(x)$ to determine which state has been marked and is therefore faster than any conceivable classical algorithm, which would need at most three evaluations of the Oracle function to determine it. Therefore, it demonstrates the concept of quantum speed-up in a straightforward and intuitive way. The schematic of our version of the Grover algorithm is shown in fig. \ref{fig:grover_algorithm_schematic} and involves two $i\mathrm{SWAP}$ gate operations and six single-qubit operations along with a single-shot qubit readout at the end of the algorithm. We implemented this algorithm with our two-qubit processor and performed quantum state tomography after each step to reconstruct the quantum state at different points in the algorithm. Fig. \ref{fig:grover_density_matrices_state_1} shows the experimentially measured density matrices when running the algorithm with an oracle that marks the state $\ket{00}$. State tomographies are shown after the first step of the algorithm (after applying a generalized Hadamard transform to the initial state $\ket{00}$), after evaluating the quantum Oracle function and after the final step of the algorithm. The measured fidelities of our implementation of the algorithm, based on the quantum state tomography of the final states for the four different Oracle functions, are $68 \%$, $61 \%$, $64 \%$ and $65 \%$.

\end{figure}


\section{Demonstrating Quantum Speed-Up}

The main interest of running a quantum algorithm is to obtain an advantage in the run-time in comparision to a classical algorithm, the so-called {\it quantum speed-up}. To characterize this quantum speed-up as obtained with our processor, we again run the Grover algorithm for all four possible Oracle functions as before, but instead of performing quantum state tomography and readout error correction, we directly read out the state of the qubit register after the last step of the algorithm {\it without} correcting any readout errors. When averaging the outcomes of many such individual runs of the algorithm with different Oracle functions we obtain the so-called {\it single-run fidelities}, which --for the four different Oracle functions-- are $66 \%$, $55\%$, $61\%$ and $52\%$, as shown in fig. \ref{fig:grover_single_shot_probabilities}. These measured single-run fidelities cleary demonstrate the quantum speed-up in our system as compared to a classical query-and-guess algorithm, that would give the correct answer with $50\%$ single-run fidelity. However, the achieved success probabilities are considerably lower than the theoretically possible value of 100 \% , which is mainly due to relaxation and decoherence of the qubit state during the running of the algorithm and to a small degree due to errors in the pulse sequence and drifts in the measurement equipment.

Shown are the probabilities of obtaining the results $00,01,10,11$ as a function of the Oracle function provided to the algorithm, indicated by the number on top of each graph. In all four cases, the success probability of the algorithm is $> 50 \%$, thus outperforming any classical query-and-guess algorithm in the required number of calls to the Oracle function.}

\section{Designing a Scalable Quantum Computing Architecture}

\comment{this section is still quite incomplete and now well-written, I have to work on the section on scalable architectures to get some more ideas}

After having demonstrated the different building blocks of a Transmon-based quantum processor it remains to be shown that larger-scale quantum-computing beyond two qubits is possible with such a system. In this work we therefore investigate the realization of a more scalable qubit architecture using systems of up to six qubits coupled through a so-called {\it quantum bus} \citep{majer_coupling_2007}. The approach for realizing a scalable quantum computing architecture pursued in this work consists of a system of many Transmon qubits equipped with individual JBA-based readouts, a multiplexed drive and readout circuit and a fixed qubit-qubit coupling mediated through a high-Q CPW resonator. As before, each qubit possesses a fluxline for fast frequency control. The readout and drive signals are send to all the qubits in parallel through a multiplexed transmission line. In this approach, the qubit and readout parameters, couplings and frequencies have to be carefully chosen to avoid unwanted coupling between individual qubits and readouts and to allow the implementation of robust quantum gates between individual qubits. In this work we realize a four-qubit chip and characterize it experimentally. The results of these experiments will be discussed in the main text of this thesis.
