This thesis presents experiments performed on a superconducting 2-Qubit quantum processor. The main goal of this work was to demonstrate a possible quantum computing architecture using superconducting qubits that follows the canonical blueprint of a 2-qubit quantum processor, as given by the four criteria formulated by \cite{divincenzo_physical_2000} and as shown in fig. \ref{fig:qubit_processor_blueprint}. In this respect, a universal quantum computer is a register of quantum bits -- or qubits -- on which one can perform universal single- and two-qubit quantum gates, read out the state of each qubit individually and with high fidelity and reset the qubit register to a well-defined state.

Implementing this allegedly simple list of requirements in a system of superconducting qubits has been a major research challenge during the last decade. After the first demonstration of coherent quantum dynamics in a superconducting charge-based qubit by \cite{nakamura_coherent_1999}, a broad research field on superconducting quantum bits was created. In the years following Nakamuras initial experiment, several types of superconducting qubits were proposed and realized, using e.g. the superconducting phase \citep{martinis_energy-level_1985,martinis_rabi_2002} across a Josephson junction or the magnetic flux \citep{mooij_josephson_1999,chiorescu_coherent_2003} inside a superconducting ring interrupted by one or several Josephson junctions as the relevant quantum variable. An important result on the way to robust superconducting qubits was the development of the so-called {\it Quantronium} qubit by \cite{vion_manipulating_2002}, which demonstrated for the first time a quantum-mechanical coherence time larger than 1 $\mu s$ by operating a Cooper pair box at a sweet spot in a regime where the charging and Josephson phase energies of the system are of comparable value. This invention made it possible to perform for the first time robust, high fidelity NMR-like quantum operations using a superconducting qubit \citep{collin_nmr-like_2004}. In 2004, the development of a new type of qubit, the so called {\it Transmon} by \cite{wallraff_strong_2004} improved again drastically the reliability of superconducting qubits by operating a Cooper pair box deep in the phase regime -- thus rendering the device almost insensitive to charge noise but leaving enough anharmonicity for use as a qubit -- and embedding it in a superconducting coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonator. This so-called {\it circuit quantum electrodyanmics} (CQED) architecture \citep{blais_cavity_2004} protects the qubit from external sources of electrical noise by placing it inside a CPW resonator, which strongly attenuates incoming signals that do not match the resonator frequency. In addition, the resonator provides a convenient readout scheme for the qubit that uses the shift of the resonance frequency of the resonator caused by a dirspersive interaction with the qubit to determine its state through a simple microwave phase measurement. Using this architecture, quantum gates and algorithms with up to four qubits have been implemented, demonstrating multi-qubit entanglement \citep{dicarlo_preparation_2010}, simple quantum algorithms \citep{dicarlo_demonstration_2009} and recently a benchmark of a teleportation protocol \citep{baur_benchmarking_2011}.

\todo{Think about moving the section on 3D-CQED directly after this one since this would probably be more logical}

In parallel to this, the development of quantum-limited amplifiers based on nonlinear superconducting resonators by \question{Should I mention Michel here?}I. Siddiqi \citep{siddiqi_rf-driven_2004} complemented the CQED architecture by providing a fast and high-fidelity readout scheme for Transmon qubits \citep{siddiqi_dispersive_2006,mallet_single-shot_2009} and for the amplification of quantum signals in general\todo{Add more citations here}. This opened the road to the direct observation of quantum jumps in superconducting qubits \citep{vijay_observation_2011} and to implementing simple forms of quantum feedback\todo{Add reference to quantum feedback paper as soon as it appears}.

Another important breakthrough was the development of a CQED architecture using 3D superconducting resonator cavities instead of 1D coplanar waveguide resonators, as pioneered by \cite{paik_observation_2011}. In this approach, by combining Transmon qubits fabricated on a Sapphire substrate and very high-Q 3D resonators it was possible to obtain an increase of qubit lifetime of one order of magnitude, with values of the relaxation time $T_1$ as high as $80 \; \mu \mathrm{s}$\todo{verify this!}. This enormous leap in coherence time will probably make possible the realization of high-fidelity quantum gates and qubit readout schemes as well as elemental quantum feedback and error correction schemes using superconducting qubits, thus providing another viable path towards implementing a working quantum computer with these structures\todo{update this section as soon as new relevant material appears}.

The research presented in this Ph.D thesis wants to complement the CQED architecture by combining a multi-qubit architecture with a single-shot, per-qubit readout and thus help to approach a viable architecture for the implementation of a superconducting quantum computer using Transmon qubits. 

The first part of this thesis discusses the realization of a superconducting quantum processor that complements the CQED architecture with a per-qubit single-shot readout. We demonstrate elemental single- and two-qubit quantum operations on this processor and use it to implement a simple quantum algorithm that demonstrates quantum speed-up. Afterwards, we discuss the realization of a four-qubit quantum processor within a more scalable architecture that fulfills -- to different degrees -- all of the diVincenzo criteria and which could possibly be extended to a larger number of qubits.

\subsection{Realizing a Two-Qubit Quantum Processor}

\begin{figure}[ht!]

	\caption[Circuit schematic of the realized two-qubit processor]{Circuit schematic of the two-qubit processor realized in this work, showing the two qubits in green, the qubit readouts in blue and the fast flux lines in red. Each qubit is embedded in its own nonlinear readout resonator and can be driven and read out through an individual microwave line.}
	\label{fig:two_qubit_processor_schematic}
\end{figure}

The quantum processor implemented in this work is shown in fig. \ref{fig:two_qubit_processor_schematic}. It consists of two superconducting quantum bits of the Transmon-type, each equipped with its own drive and readout circuit. The qubit readout is realized by using a nonlinear coplanar-waveguide resonator which serves as a Josephson bifurcation amplifier (JBA) and allows a high-fidelity, single-shot readout of the qubit state. Each qubit can be manipulated by driving it with microwave pulses through its readout resonator, allowing high-fidelity single-qubit operations. In addition, the qubit frequencies can be tuned individually by fast flux lines, which allows fast frequency control over the range of several GHz for each qubit. The coupling between the two qubits is realized through a fixed capacitor that directly connects the two qubits and implements a fixed $\sigma_{xx}$-type qubit-qubit coupling. This allows to implement two-qubit gates and to generate entangled two-qubit states. We use this processor to test Bell's inequality, implement an universal two-qubit gate and perform a simple quantum algorithm that demonstrates quantum speed-up, as will be discussed in the following sections.

\subsection{Demonstrating Simultaneous Single-Shot Readout}

\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=1.\textwidth]{./material/papers/grover/figures/simultaneous_readout_characteristics}
	\caption[Switching probabilities of the two qubit readouts as a function of the readout excitation power]{a) Switching probabilities of the two qubit readouts as a function of the readout excitation power. The measurement is performed after preparing the qubits in the states $\color{blue}{\ket{0}}$, $\color{red}{\ket{1}}$ and $\color{brown}{\ket{2}}$. The readout fidelity is given as the difference in probability between the curves corresponding to the states $\color{blue}{\ket{0}}$ and $\color{red}{\ket{1}}$ or $\color{brown}{\ket{2}}$, respectively. The highest readout fidelites of 88 and 89 \% are achieved when the qubit is in state $\color{brown}{\ket{2}}$. b) Readout matrix of the two-qubit system. The matrix contains the probabilities of obtaining a given measurement result after having prepared the system in a given state. \figcomment{Replace this figure since it is not very intuitive. It would be better to show something which allows the reader to directly quantify the visibility and readout crosstalk present in the system.}}
	\label{fig:qubit_readout_characteristics}
\end{figure}

The read out of the qubit state is done by using a so-called Josephson bifurcation amplifier \citep{siddiqi_dispersive_2006,mallet_single-shot_2009}. This readout works by capacitively coupling the qubit to a coplanar waveguide resonator which is rendered nonlinear by adding a Josephson junction at the center of the resonator. This nonlinear resonator can exhibit bistable behaviour for certain drive parameters, which we use to map the state of the qubit to one of the bistable states of the resonator, thus obtaining a high-fidelity, single-shot readout of the qubit state. In contrast to other CQED architectures, each of the two qubits of the processor possesses its own JBA readout, allowing a simultaneous measurement of the state of the whole qubit register and thus following closely the diVincenzo criteria.\todo{discuss more details of the readout here...} The readout fidelity attained with a JBA readout can be as high as 93 \% \citep{mallet_single-shot_2009}, but due to design contraints was usually around 83-85 \% for the quantum processor realized here, as shown in fig. \ref{fig:qubit_readout_characteristics}.

\subsection{Generating and Characterizating Entanglement}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{./material/papers/iswap/submission1/Dewes_Figure2}
	\caption[Generating entangled two-qubit states by swapping interaction]{Energy oscillations between the two qubits induced by a resonant swapping interaction between them. a) The qubit state after switching on the swapping interaction for a given time $\Delta t$. The frequency of the oscillations corresponds to $2g = 8.7 \; \mathrm{MHz}$. b) The Pauli set of the two-qubit state measured at $0\; \mathrm{ns}$ and $31\; \mathrm{ns}$. c) The reconstructed density matrices corresponding to the two measured Pauli sets. In c), the area of each circle corresponds to the absolute value of each matrix element and the color and direction of the arrow give the phase of each element. The black circles correspond to the density matrices of the ideal states $\ket{10}$ and $1/\sqrt{2}/(\ket{10}+i\ket{01})$, respectively.\figcomment{verify sign!}}
	\label{fig:swap_interaction_state_tomography}
\end{figure}

The fixed coupling between the two qubits provides a $\sigma_{xx}$-type coupling which is only effective when the qubit frequencies are nearly resonant. Therefore, it can be switched on and off by changing the qubit frequencies, which we use to implement two-qubit gates with this system. In our processor, the effective coupling constant $g$ of the two qubits is given as $2g = 8.2 \; \mathrm{MHz}$\todo{Check if this is really $2g$!}. When using a fast fluxline pulse to abruptly tune the qubits in resonance we can switch on the qubit-qubit coupling non-adiabatically and produce an evolution of the qubit state of the form

\begin{equation}
	U(t)  =  \left( \begin{array}{cccc} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \cos{2 \pi t g} & i\sin{2 \pi t g} & 0 \\ 0 & i\sin{2 \pi t g} & \cos{2 \pi t g} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{array} \right) \label{eq:swap_evolution_operator}
\end{equation}

%explain that we stop the evolution at the right time to generate entangled states and implement a 2-qubit gate.

When switching of the interaction after a time $t_{\pi/2} = 1/8 g$ we can create entangled qubit states and realize a universal quantum gate, as will be explained later. First, to characterize the state evoluation of the system according to eq. (\ref{eq:swap_evolution_operator}), we prepare the system in the state $\ket{10}$ and switch on the interaction between the qubits for a given amount of time. When measuring the state of the qubits after this operation we observe energy oscillations between the two qubits, as shown in fig. \ref{fig:swap_interaction_state_tomography}a. Stopping the interaction after quarter of a period we obtain an entangled two-qubit Bell-type state that we characterize by quantum state tomography. The experimental reconstruction of the density matrix of a state approximating a Bell-state $\ket{\psi} = 1/\sqrt{2}(\ket{01}+i\ket{10})$ is shown in fig. \ref{fig:swap_interaction_state_tomography}b. The measured fidelity of this state of 91 \% and the concurrence of 85 \% indicates a high amount of entanglement present in the system. The entanglement between the two qubits produced in our experiment can also be characterized by measuring the so-called {\it Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt} operator \citep{clauser_proposed_1969}, which is given as

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{CHSH} = \mathrm{QS}+\mathrm{RS}+\mathrm{RT}-\mathrm{QT}
\end{equation}
and with the operators $\mathrm{Q,R,S,T}$ as

\begin{eqnarray}
	\begin{array}{cccccccc}
		\mathrm{Q} & = & \sigma_z^1 &&& \mathrm{S} & = & \sigma_z^2\cdot \cos{\phi}+\sigma_x^2 \cdot \sin{\phi} \\
		\mathrm{R} & = & \sigma_x^1 &&& \mathrm{T} & = & -\sigma_z^2\cdot \sin{\phi}+\sigma_x^2 \cdot \cos{\phi}
	\end{array}
\end{eqnarray} 
Here, the angle $\phi$ is a parameter that can be freely choosen.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{./material/papers/iswap/submission1/Dewes_Figure3}
	\caption[Measurement of the CHSH operator of an entanged two-qubit state]{Measurement of the CHSH equation for an entangled two-qubit state. The renormalized CHSH expectation value (red points) exceeds the classical boundary of $2$ by a large amount. The raw measurement data (blue points) lies below this critical threshold. The inset shows the standard deviation $\sigma$ at the highest point of the curve as a function of the measurement sample size. For the highest sample count, the classical boundary is exceeded by $22$ standard deviations.\figcomment{p. 140 in cavities 6 labbook}}
	\label{fig:chsh_measurement}
\end{figure}

The expectation value $\bracket{CHSH}$ provides a test of the quantum-mechanical character of the generated state. For classical states, the maximum value is $\le 2$ but for entangled, quantum-mechanical states it can reach a maximum value of $\sqrt{2}\cdot 2$. The result of a CHSH-type measurement performed on an entangled state generated by the above method is shown in fig. \ref{fig:chsh_measurement}, showing the value of $\bracket{CHSH}$ as a function of $\phi$. We observe a violation of the classical boundary $2$ of the operator by $22$ standard deviations when correcting readout errors present in our system. The raw, uncorrected data fails however to exceed the non-classical bound of $2$, making it impossible to close the detection loophole with our system but providing nevertheless a strong indication of the presence of entanglement in the system.

\subsection{Realizing a Universal Two-Qubit Quantum Gate}

\begin{SCfigure}[][ht!]
		\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{./material/papers/iswap/figures/chi_matrix}
	\caption[Measured $\chi$-matrix of the $\sqrt{i\textrm{SWAP}}$ gate]{The measured $\chi$-matrix of the implemented $\sqrt{i\mathrm{SWAP}}$ gate. The row labels correspond to the indices of the $E_i$ operators, the height of each bar to the absolute value of the corresponding matrix element and the color and direction of the red arrow to the complex phase of each element. The ideal $\chi$-matrix of the $i\sqrt{\mathrm{SWAP}}$ gate is given by the outlined bars. The upper half of the positive-hermitian matrix is not shown.}
	\label{fig:gate_chi_matrix_and_errors}
\end{SCfigure}

The swapping evolution according to eq. (\ref{eq:swap_evolution_operator}) allows the implementation of a two-qubit gate. When switching on the interaction for $t_{\pi/2} = 1/8g$ we realize the so-called $\sqrt{i\mathrm{SWAP}}$ gate, which has the representation

\begin{equation}
	\sqrt{i\mathrm{SWAP}}  =  \left( \begin{array}{cccc} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1/\sqrt{2} & i/\sqrt{2} & 0 \\ 0 & i/\sqrt{2} & 1/\sqrt{2} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{array} \right) \label{eq:sqrt_iswap_gate}
\end{equation}
and is universal in the two-qubit basis. The measured gate fidelity was 90 \% for our quantum processor, which is sufficiently good to allow us to implement a simple quantum algorithm with the system. The 10 \% error in gate fidelity was caused mainly by qubit relaxation and dephasing during the gate operation and only marginally by deterministic preparation errors, as will be discussed in the main text of this thesis. Fig. \ref{fig:gate_chi_matrix_and_errors} show the measured $\chi$ matrix of the implemented gate.

\subsection{Running a Quantum-Search Algorithm}

\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./material/papers/grover/figures/grover_algorithm_schematic}
	\caption[Schematic of the implementation of Grovers search algorithm]{Schematic of the implementation of Grovers search algorithm on a two-qubit quantum processor. The algorithm consists in preparing a probe state, applying the quantum oracle to this state and analyzing the resulting output state to extract the information on the oracle operator.} 
	\label{fig:grover_algorithm_schematic}
\end{figure}

The demonstration of quantum speed-up is an important benchmark for any prospective quantum processor. In this work we implemented a compiled version of Grover's search algorithm \citep{Grover_Quantum_1997}. Our version of the algorithm works in the basis of two qubits $x_i \in \{\ket{00},\ket{01},\ket{10},\ket{11}\}$ and in theory can distinguish between four different {\it oracle functions} $f(x)$ that each mark a specified state $x_j$ and leave the other states unchanged. Since the algorithm requires only one evaluation of the function $f(x)$ to determine which state has been marked it is 50 \% faster than any conceivable classical algorithm\comment{discuss again if this should be 25 \% or 50 \%}. The schematic of this algorithm is shown in fig. \ref{fig:grover_algorithm_schematic} and involves two $i\mathrm{SWAP}$ gates and three single-qubit operations along with a single-shot qubit readout at the end of the algorithm. The run time of this algorithm on our processor is approximately $160\;\mathrm{ns}$, the measured results will be discussed in the following section. 
\todo{Add state tomographies after different steps of the algorithm and briefly discuss different error sources when running it.}

\subsection{Demonstrating Quantum Speed-Up}

The main interest of running a quantum algorithm is to obtain an advantage in the run-time in comparision with a classical algorithm, the so-called {\it quantum speed-up}. To characterize this quantum speed-up as obtained with our processor, we run Grovers algorithm for all four possible oracle functions and directly readout out the qubit state after the last step of the algorithm, without correcting any readout errors. When averaging the results of such individual runs of the algorithm we can then obtain its single-run fidelity, which --for our processor-- ranges between 52 and 67 \%, depending on the state which is  marked by the quantum oracle, as shown in fig. \ref{fig:grover_single_shot_probabilities}. These results clearly demonstrate quantum speed-up in this system, although the achieved success probability is considerably lower than the theoretically possible value of 100 \% . The reduced fidelity is mainly due to relaxation and decoherence of the qubit state during the running of the algorithm and to a very small degree due to errors in the pulse sequence and drifts in the measurement equipment.

\begin{figure}[ht!]

Shown are the probabilities of obtaining the results $00,01,10,11$ as a function of the oracle function provided to the algorithm, indicated by the number on top of each graph. In all four cases, the success probability of the algorithm is $> 50 \%$, thus outperforming any classical algorithm in the number of calls to the oracle function.}
	\label{fig:grover_single_shot_probabilities}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Designing a Scalable Quantum Computing Architecture}

After having demonstrated the different building blocks of a superconducting, Transmon-based quantum processor it remains to be shown that larger-scale quantum-computing beyond two qubits is possible with this system. This work therefore pursued the realization of a more scalable qubit architecture using systems of up to six qubits coupled through a so-called ``quantum bus'' \citep{majer_coupling_2007}. The details of this novel architecture are discussed in the following sections.

The approach for scalable quantum computing with superconducting qubits pursued in this work consists of a system of many individual Transmon qubits equipped with individual JBA-based readouts, a multiplexed drive and readout circuit and a fixed qubit-qubit coupling mediated through a high-Q CPW resonator. As before, each qubit possesses a fluxline for fast frequency control. The readout and drive signals are send to all the qubits in parallel through a multiplexed 50 $\Omega$ transmission line. In this approach, the frequencies of the JBA readouts have to be chosen such that driving individual readouts at a given frequency does not induce crosstalk or spurious coupling to other readout resonators. Also, the transition frequencies of all qubits have to be chosen such that it becomes possible to individually address each of them without inducing transitions in the other qubit states.
