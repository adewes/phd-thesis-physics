Using full quantum state tomography and evaluating an entanglement witness, we show that the protocol generates a genuine tripartite entangled state of all three-qubits. Calculating the projection of the measured density matrix onto the basis states of two qubits allows us to reconstruct the teleported state. Repeating this procedure for a complete set of input states we find an average output state fidelity of 88\%.},

Advantages of this architecture are that it allows for multiqubit gates between non-nearest qubits and for the realization of gates in parallel, opening the possibility of fault-tolerant quantum computation with superconduting circuits. In this paper, we focus on one- and two-qubit gates that do not require moving away from the charge-degeneracy “sweet spot.” This is advantageous as it helps to increase the qubit dephasing time and does not require modification of the original circuit {QED.} However, these gates can, in some cases, be slower than those that do not use this constraint. Five types of two-qubit gates are discussed, these include gates based on virtual photons, real excitation of the resonator, and a gate based on the geometric phase.

The persistent voltage is a periodic function of the control charge with period 2e if Cooper pairs only are present and with period e if quasiparticles are included. In the capacitively coupled junction, Bloch oscillations are induced by increasing the control charge linearly in time. The presence of a persistent voltage drop is reflected in the small-signal impedance of the circuit which describes the response of the junction to an oscillating control charge superimposed on a static control charge. The impedance reveals features which seem closely related to experimental observations by Lambe and Jaklevic {[Phys.} Rev.

However, the amount of resources needed for quantum tomography is exponential in the device size. Part of the problem is that tomography generates much more information than is usually sought. Taking a more targeted approach, we develop schemes that enable (i) estimating the fidelity of an experiment to a theoretical ideal description, (ii) learning which description within a reduced subset best matches the experimental data. Both these approaches yield a significant reduction in resources compared to tomography. In particular, we demonstrate that fidelity can be estimated from a number of simple experiments that is independent of the system size, removing an important roadblock for the experimental study of larger quantum information processing units.},

	abstract = {It is argued that underlying the {Church-Turing} hypothesis there is an implicit physical assertion. Here, this assertion is presented explicitly as a physical principle: `every finitely realizible physical system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing machine operating by finite means'. Classical physics and the universal Turing machine, because the former is continuous and the latter discrete, do not obey the principle, at least in the strong form above. A class of model computing machines that is the quantum generalization of the class of Turing machines is described, and it is shown that quantum theory and the `universal quantum computer' are compatible with the principle. Computing machines resembling the universal quantum computer could, in principle, be built and would have many remarkable properties not reproducible by any Turing machine. These do not include the computation of non-recursive functions, but they do include `quantum parallelism', a method by which certain probabilistic tasks can be performed faster by a universal quantum computer than by any classical restriction of it. The intuitive explanation of these properties places an intolerable strain on all interpretations of quantum theory other than Everett's. Some of the numerous connections between the quantum theory of computation and the rest of physics are explored. Quantum complexity theory allows a physically more reasonable definition of the `complexity' or `knowledge' in a physical system than does classical complexity theory.},

Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false.

It allows a quantum system to be 'in two places at the same time', because the quantum state of a physical system can simultaneously include measurably different physical states.

The creation of complex superpositions in harmonic systems (such as the motional state of trapped ions, microwave resonators or optical cavities) has presented a significant challenge because it cannot be achieved with classical control signals. Here we demonstrate the preparation and measurement of arbitrary quantum states in an electromagnetic resonator, superposing states with different numbers of photons in a completely controlled and deterministic manner. We synthesize the states using a superconducting phase qubit to phase-coherently pump photons into the resonator, making use of an algorithm that generalizes a previously demonstrated method of generating photon number {(Fock)} states in a resonator.

Many measurements are destructive, removing more information from the system than they obtain. Quantum non-demolition {(QND)} measurements allow repeated measurements that give the same eigenvalue1. They could be used for several quantum information processing tasks such as error correction2, preparation by measurement3 and one-way quantum computing4. Achieving {QND} measurements of photons is especially challenging because the detector must be completely transparent to the photons while still acquiring information about them5, 6. Recent progress in manipulating microwave photons in superconducting circuits7, 8, 9 has increased demand for a {QND} detector that operates in the gigahertz frequency range. Here we demonstrate a {QND} detection scheme that measures the number of photons inside a high-quality-factor microwave cavity on a chip. This scheme maps a photon number, n, onto a qubit state in a single-shot by means of qubit–photon logic gates. We verify the operation of the device for n=0 and 1 by analysing the average correlations of repeated measurements, and show that it is 90\% {QND.} It differs from previously reported detectors5, 8, 9, 10, 11 because its sensitivity is strongly selective to chosen photon number states.

	abstract = {Short dephasing times pose one of the main challenges in realizing a quantum computer. Different approaches have been devised to cure this problem for superconducting qubits, a prime example being the operation of such devices at optimal working points, so-called “sweet spots.” This latter approach led to significant improvement of T2 times in Cooper pair box qubits [ D. Vion et al. Science 296 886 (2002)]. Here, we introduce a new type of superconducting qubit called the “transmon.” Unlike the charge qubit, the transmon is designed to operate in a regime of significantly increased ratio of Josephson energy and charging energy {EJ∕EC.} The transmon benefits from the fact that its charge dispersion decreases exponentially with {EJ∕EC}, while its loss in anharmonicity is described by a weak power law. As a result, we predict a drastic reduction in sensitivity to charge noise relative to the Cooper pair box and an increase in the qubit-photon coupling, while maintaining sufficient anharmonicity for selective qubit control. Our detailed analysis of the full system shows that this gain is not compromised by increased noise in other known channels.},

The behavior of δ was deduced from measurements of the escape rate Γ of the junction from its zero-voltage state. The relevant parameters of the junction, that is, its critical current and shunting admittance, were determined in situ in the thermal regime from the dependence of Γ on bias current and from resonant activation in the presence of microwaves. It was found that the shunting capacitance was dominated by the self-capacitance of the junction while the shunting conductance was dominated by the bias circuitry. For an underdamped junction in the quantum regime, Γ became independent of temperature at low temperatures with a value that, with no adjustable parameters, was in excellent agreement with predictions for macroscopic quantum tunneling at T=0. When the critical current was reduced with a magnetic field so that the junction remained in the thermal regime at low temperatures, Γ followed the predictions of the thermal model, thereby showing the influence of extraneous noise to be negligible. In a further series of experiments, the existence of quantized energy levels in the potential well of the junction was demonstrated spectroscopically. The positions of the energy levels agreed quantitatively with quantum-mechanical predictions involving junction parameters measured in the thermal regime. The relative heights and widths of the resonances are in reasonable agreement with the predictions of a simple model.},

With the new architecture, we demonstrate that Josephson junction qubits are highly coherent, with T2∼10 to 20 μs without the use of spin echo, and highly stable, showing no evidence for 1/f critical current noise.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.4948},
	abstract = {Quantum computers promise to solve certain problems exponentially faster than possible classically but are challenging to build because of their increased susceptibility to errors. Remarkably, however, it is possible to detect and correct errors without destroying coherence by using quantum error correcting codes [1]. The simplest of these are the three-qubit codes, which map a one-qubit state to an entangled three-qubit state and can correct any single phase-flip or bit-flip error of one of the three qubits, depending on the code used [2]. Here we demonstrate both codes in a superconducting circuit by encoding a quantum state as previously shown [3,4], inducing errors on all three qubits with some probability, and decoding the error syndrome by reversing the encoding process. This syndrome is then used as the input to a three-qubit gate which corrects the primary qubit if it was flipped. As the code can recover from a single error on any qubit, the fidelity of this process should decrease only quadratically with error probability. We implement the correcting three-qubit gate, known as a conditional-conditional {NOT} {(CCNot)} or Toffoli gate, using an interaction with the third excited state of a single qubit, in 63 ns. We find 85{\textbackslash}pm1\% fidelity to the expected classical action of this gate and 78{\textbackslash}pm1\% fidelity to the ideal quantum process matrix. Using it, we perform a single pass of both quantum bit- and phase-flip error correction with 76{\textbackslash}pm0.5\% process fidelity and demonstrate the predicted first-order insensitivity to errors. Concatenating these two codes and performing them on a nine-qubit device would correct arbitrary single-qubit errors. When combined with recent advances in superconducting qubit coherence times [5,6], this may lead to scalable quantum technology.},

	abstract = {Protecting the dynamics of coupled quantum systems from decoherence by the environment is a key challenge for solid-state quantum information processing1, 2. An idle quantum bit (qubit) can be efficiently insulated from the outside world by dynamical decoupling3, as has recently been demonstrated for individual solid-state qubits4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. However, protecting qubit coherence during a multi-qubit gate is a non-trivial problem3, 10, 11: in general, the decoupling disrupts the interqubit dynamics and hence conflicts with gate operation. This problem is particularly salient for hybrid systems12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, in which different types of qubit evolve and decohere at very different rates. Here we present the integration of dynamical decoupling into quantum gates for a standard hybrid system, the electron–nuclear spin register. Our design harnesses the internal resonance in the coupled-spin system to resolve the conflict between gate operation and decoupling. We experimentally demonstrate these gates using a two-qubit register in diamond operating at room temperature. Quantum tomography reveals that the qubits involved in the gate operation are protected as accurately as idle qubits. We also perform Grover’s quantum search algorithm1, and achieve fidelities of more than 90\% even though the algorithm run-time exceeds the electron spin dephasing time by two orders of magnitude. Our results directly allow decoherence-protected interface gates between different types of solid-state qubit. Ultimately, quantum gates with integrated decoupling may reach the accuracy threshold for fault-tolerant quantum information processing with solid-state devices1, 11.},

	abstract = {Electromagnetic signals are always composed of photons, although in the circuit domain those signals are carried as voltages and currents on wires, and the discreteness of the photon's energy is usually not evident. However, by coupling a superconducting quantum bit (qubit) to signals on a microwave transmission line, it is possible to construct an integrated circuit in which the presence or absence of even a single photon can have a dramatic effect. Such a system1 can be described by circuit quantum electrodynamics {(QED)—the} circuit equivalent of cavity {QED}, where photons interact with atoms or quantum dots. Previously, circuit {QED} devices were shown to reach the resonant strong coupling regime, where a single qubit could absorb and re-emit a single photon many times2. Here we report a circuit {QED} experiment in the strong dispersive limit, a new regime where a single photon has a large effect on the qubit without ever being absorbed. The hallmark of this strong dispersive regime is that the qubit transition energy can be resolved into a separate spectral line for each photon number state of the microwave field. The strength of each line is a measure of the probability of finding the corresponding photon number in the cavity. This effect is used to distinguish between coherent and thermal fields, and could be used to create a photon statistics analyser. As no photons are absorbed by this process, it should be possible to generate non-classical states of light by measurement and perform qubit–photon conditional logic, the basis of a logic bus for a quantum computer.},

This circuit has a special bias point where the Larmor frequency is, to first order, insensitive to fluctuations in the bias parameters—the charge of the box island and the phase of the large junction. At this optimal working point, the state of the qubit can be determined by dispersive measurements that probe the second derivative of the state energy with respect to these bias parameters. We use the quantronium phase degree of freedom to perform a nonlinear, dispersive measurement of its inductive response using bifurcation amplification. This dispersive readout projects the state of the qubit in a few nanoseconds, and its latching property allows us to record the resulting information in a few hundred nanoseconds. We have measured, using this technique, Rabi oscillations and Ramsey fringes with an improved signal-to-noise ratio and contrast. The speed of this readout scheme also opens the door for a class of experiments that would characterize the relaxation processes associated with the measurement protocol.},

A weak input signal to the amplifier couples to the junction critical current I0 and results in a dispersive shift in the resonator plasma frequency ωp. This shift is enhanced by biasing the junction with a sufficiently strong microwave current Irf to access the nonlinear regime where ωp varies with Irf. For a drive frequency ωd such that Ω = {2Q(1−ωd/ωp){\textgreater}}, the oscillator enters the bistable regime where two nondissipative dynamical states {OL} and {OH}, which differ in amplitude and phase, can exist. The sharp I0 dependent transition from {OL} to {OH} forms the basis for a sensitive digital threshold amplifier. In the vicinity of the bistable regime (Ω{\textless}), analog amplification of continuous signals is also possible. We present experimental data characterizing amplifier performance and discuss two specific applications—the readout of superconducting qubits (digital mode) and dispersive microwave magnetometry (analog mode).},
