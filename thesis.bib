	abstract = {Complete and precise characterization of a quantum dynamical process can be achieved via the method of quantum process tomography. Using a source of correlated photons, we have implemented several methods, each investigating a wide range of processes, e.g., unitary, decohering, and polarizing. One of these methods, ancilla-assisted process tomography {(AAPT)}, makes use of an additional “ancilla system,” and we have theoretically determined the conditions when {AAPT} is possible. Surprisingly, entanglement is not required. We present data obtained using both separable and entangled input states. The use of entanglement yields superior results, however.},

Impressive progress has been achieved in isolating quantum systems from the environment and coherently controlling their dynamics, as demonstrated by the creation and manipulation of entanglement in various physical systems. However, for open quantum systems, engineering the dynamics of many particles by a controlled coupling to an environment remains largely unexplored. Here we realize an experimental toolbox for simulating an open quantum system with up to five quantum bits (qubits). Using a quantum computing architecture with trapped ions, we combine multi-qubit gates with optical pumping to implement coherent operations and dissipative processes. We illustrate our ability to engineer the open-system dynamics through the dissipative preparation of entangled states, the simulation of coherent many-body spin interactions, and the quantum non-demolition measurement of multi-qubit observables. By adding controlled dissipation to coherent operations, this work offers novel prospects for open-system quantum simulation and computation.},

If the pulse envelope is rectangular, there are extensive sidelobes in the frequency-domain excitation pattern, whereas a Gaussian envelope gives a frequency-domain pattern (for the absolute-value mode) that is a slightly distorted Gaussian with no sidelobes. This affords much better selectivity. Furthermore the Gaussian pulse excites a signal with a phase angle which is almost a linear function of offset. The calculations are based on magnetization trajectories predicted by the Bloch equations, neglecting relaxation. It is shown that at appreciable offsets from resonance the Gaussian pulse produces a characteristic “teardrop” trajectory which always terminates near the {+Z} axis, irrespective of offset {ΔB.} Examples of applications of Gaussian-shaped pulses include the investigation of the fine structure on carbon-13 resonances, selective coherence transfer experiments between protons, and nuclear Overhauser effect measurements in crowded proton spectra.},

In this article, we focus on the influence of thermal fluctuations in a weakly damped circuit resonance coupled to the qubit. Because of the coupling, the qubit frequency is shifted by an amount \$n {\textbackslash}delta {\textbackslash}nu\_0\$ if the resonator contains \$n\$ energy quanta. Thermal fluctuations induce temporal variations \$n(t)\$ and thus dephasing. We give an approximate formula for the qubit dephasing time as a function of \${\textbackslash}delta {\textbackslash}nu\_0\$. We discuss the specific case of a flux-qubit coupled to the plasma mode of its {DC-SQUID} detector. We first derive a plasma mode-qubit interaction hamiltonian which, in addition to the usual Jaynes-Cummings term, has a coupling term quadratic in the oscillator variables coming from the flux-dependence of the {SQUID} Josephson inductance. Our model predicts that \${\textbackslash}delta {\textbackslash}nu\_0\$ cancels in certain non-trivial bias conditions for which dephasing due to thermal fluctuations should be suppressed.},

In this paper, we focus on one- and two-qubit gates that do not require moving away from the charge-degeneracy “sweet spot.” This is advantageous as it helps to increase the qubit dephasing time and does not require modification of the original circuit {QED.} However, these gates can, in some cases, be slower than those that do not use this constraint.

The vacuum Rabi frequency for the coupling of cavity photons to quantized excitations of an adjacent electrical circuit (qubit) can easily exceed the damping rates of both the cavity and qubit. This architecture is attractive both as a macroscopic analog of atomic physics experiments and for quantum computing and control, since it provides strong inhibition of spontaneous emission, potentially leading to greatly enhanced qubit lifetimes, allows high-fidelity quantum nondemolition measurements of the state of multiple qubits, and has a natural mechanism for entanglement of qubits separated by centimeter distances. In addition it would allow production of microwave photon states of fundamental importance for quantum communication.},

The master equation for the superconducting phases in the Born-Markov approximation is derived and brought into the Bloch-Redfield form in order to describe multilevel dissipative quantum dynamics of the circuit. The model takes into account leakage effects, i.e., transitions from the allowed qubit states to higher excited states of the system. As a special case, we truncate the Hilbert space and derive a two-level {(Bloch)} theory with characteristic relaxation {(T1)} and decoherence {(T2)} times.

Capacitive coupling permits one to control the charge on the junction and to hold the junction in an equilibrium state. The equilibrium state is characterized by a persistent voltage drop without an accompanying dc current. The persistent voltage is a periodic function of the control charge with period 2e if Cooper pairs only are present and with period e if quasiparticles are included. In the capacitively coupled junction, Bloch oscillations are induced by increasing the control charge linearly in time. The presence of a persistent voltage drop is reflected in the small-signal impedance of the circuit which describes the response of the junction to an oscillating control charge superimposed on a static control charge. The impedance reveals features which seem closely related to experimental observations by Lambe and Jaklevic {[Phys.} Rev.

The algorithm can be used, for example, to compile Shor's algorithm, which uses rotations of \${\textbackslash}pi / 2{\textasciicircum}k\$, into an efficient fault-tolerant form using only Hadamard, controlled-{{\textbackslash}sc not}, and \${\textbackslash}pi / 8\$ gates. The algorithm runs in {\$O({\textbackslash}log{\textasciicircum}{2.71}(1/{\textbackslash}epsilon))\$} time, and produces as output a sequence of {\$O({\textbackslash}log{\textasciicircum}{3.97}(1/{\textbackslash}epsilon))\$} quantum gates which is guaranteed to approximate the desired quantum gate to an accuracy within \${\textbackslash}epsilon {\textgreater} 0\$. We also explain how the algorithm can be generalized to apply to multi-qubit gates and to gates from {\$SU(d)\$.}},

	abstract = {It is argued that underlying the Church-Turing hypothesis there is an implicit physical assertion. Here, this assertion is presented explicitly as a physical principle: `every finitely realizible physical system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing machine operating by finite means'. Classical physics and the universal Turing machine, because the former is continuous and the latter discrete, do not obey the principle, at least in the strong form above. A class of model computing machines that is the quantum generalization of the class of Turing machines is described, and it is shown that quantum theory and the `universal quantum computer' are compatible with the principle. Computing machines resembling the universal quantum computer could, in principle, be built and would have many remarkable properties not reproducible by any Turing machine. These do not include the computation of non-recursive functions, but they do include `quantum parallelism', a method by which certain probabilistic tasks can be performed faster by a universal quantum computer than by any classical restriction of it. The intuitive explanation of these properties places an intolerable strain on all interpretations of quantum theory other than Everett's. Some of the numerous connections between the quantum theory of computation and the rest of physics are explored. Quantum complexity theory allows a physically more reasonable definition of the `complexity' or `knowledge' in a physical system than does classical complexity theory.},

Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

The evolution of the quantum state is governed by a time-dependent Hamiltonian that interpolates between an initial Hamiltonian, whose ground state is easy to construct, and a final Hamiltonian, whose ground state encodes the satisfying assignment. To ensure that the system evolves to the desired final ground state, the evolution time must be big enough. The time required depends on the minimum energy difference between the two lowest states of the interpolating Hamiltonian. We are unable to estimate this gap in general. We give some special symmetric cases of the satisfiability problem where the symmetry allows us to estimate the gap and we show that, in these cases, our algorithm runs in polynomial time.},

However, the Dirac equation also predicts some peculiar effects, such as Klein’s paradox and {‘Zitterbewegung’}, an unexpected quivering motion of a free relativistic quantum particle. These and other predicted phenomena are key fundamental examples for understanding relativistic quantum effects, but are difficult to observe in real particles. In recent years, there has been increased interest in simulations of relativistic quantum effects using different physical set-ups, in which parameter tunability allows access to different physical regimes. Here we perform a proof-of-principle quantum simulation of the one-dimensional Dirac equation using a single trapped ion set to behave as a free relativistic quantum particle. We measure the particle position as a function of time and study Zitterbewegung for different initial superpositions of positive- and negative-energy spinor states, as well as the crossover from relativistic to non-relativistic dynamics. The high level of control of trapped-ion experimental parameters makes it possible to simulate textbook examples of relativistic quantum physics.},

The microwave transmission spectra measured at temperatures of 20 {mK} are shown to be in good agreement with theoretical lumped element and distributed element transmission matrix models. In particular, the experimentally determined resonance frequencies, quality factors, and insertion losses are fully and consistently explained by the two models for all measured devices.

It allows a quantum system to be 'in two places at the same time', because the quantum state of a physical system can simultaneously include measurably different physical states. The preparation and use of such superposed states forms the basis of quantum computation and simulation. The creation of complex superpositions in harmonic systems (such as the motional state of trapped ions, microwave resonators or optical cavities) has presented a significant challenge because it cannot be achieved with classical control signals. Here we demonstrate the preparation and measurement of arbitrary quantum states in an electromagnetic resonator, superposing states with different numbers of photons in a completely controlled and deterministic manner. We synthesize the states using a superconducting phase qubit to phase-coherently pump photons into the resonator, making use of an algorithm that generalizes a previously demonstrated method of generating photon number {(Fock)} states in a resonator. We completely characterize the resonator quantum state using Wigner tomography, which is equivalent to measuring the resonator's full density matrix.},

	abstract = {Thorough control of quantum measurement is key to the development of quantum information technologies. Many measurements are destructive, removing more information from the system than they obtain. Quantum non-demolition {(QND)} measurements allow repeated measurements that give the same eigenvalue1. They could be used for several quantum information processing tasks such as error correction2, preparation by measurement3 and one-way quantum computing4. Achieving {QND} measurements of photons is especially challenging because the detector must be completely transparent to the photons while still acquiring information about them5, 6. Recent progress in manipulating microwave photons in superconducting circuits7, 8, 9 has increased demand for a {QND} detector that operates in the gigahertz frequency range. Here we demonstrate a {QND} detection scheme that measures the number of photons inside a high-quality-factor microwave cavity on a chip. This scheme maps a photon number, n, onto a qubit state in a single-shot by means of qubit–photon logic gates. We verify the operation of the device for n=0 and 1 by analysing the average correlations of repeated measurements, and show that it is 90\% {QND.} It differs from previously reported detectors5, 8, 9, 10, 11 because its sensitivity is strongly selective to chosen photon number states. This scheme could be used to monitor the state of a photon-based memory in a quantum computer.},

One of the greatest challenges now is to implement the basic quantum-computational elements in a physical system and to demonstrate that they can be reliably and scalably controlled. One of the earliest proposals for quantum computation is based on implementing a quantum bit with two optical modes containing one photon. The proposal is appealing because of the ease with which photon interference can be observed. Until now, it suffered from the requirement for non-linear couplings between optical modes containing few photons. Here we show that efficient quantum computation is possible using only beam splitters, phase shifters, single photon sources and photo-detectors. Our methods exploit feedback from photo-detectors and are robust against errors from photon loss and detector inefficiency. The basic elements are accessible to experimental investigation with current technology.},

Different approaches have been devised to cure this problem for superconducting qubits, a prime example being the operation of such devices at optimal working points, so-called “sweet spots.” This latter approach led to significant improvement of T2 times in Cooper pair box qubits [ D. Vion et al. Science 296 886 (2002)]. Here, we introduce a new type of superconducting qubit called the “transmon.” Unlike the charge qubit, the transmon is designed to operate in a regime of significantly increased ratio of Josephson energy and charging energy {EJ∕EC.} The transmon benefits from the fact that its charge dispersion decreases exponentially with {EJ∕EC}, while its loss in anharmonicity is described by a weak power law. As a result, we predict a drastic reduction in sensitivity to charge noise relative to the Cooper pair box and an increase in the qubit-photon coupling, while maintaining sufficient anharmonicity for selective qubit control. Our detailed analysis of the full system shows that this gain is not compromised by increased noise in other known channels.},

In particular, we consider the {√iSWAP} gate realized with superconducting phase qubits and calculate the {QPT} matrix χ in the presence of several local and nonlocal decoherence processes. We determine specific patterns of these decoherence processes, which can be used for a fast identification of the main decoherence mechanisms from an experimental χ matrix.},

We strongly suppressed the coupling of a single spin in diamond with the surrounding spin bath by using double-axis dynamical decoupling. The coherence was preserved for arbitrary quantum states, as verified by quantum process tomography. The resulting coherence time enhancement followed a general scaling with the number of decoupling pulses. No limit was observed for the decoupling action up to 136 pulses, for which the coherence time was enhanced more than 25 times compared to that obtained with spin echo. These results uncover a new regime for experimental quantum science and allow us to overcome a major hurdle for implementing quantum information protocols.},

	abstract = {Experiments are described that demonstrate the quantum behavior of a macroscopic degree of freedom, namely the phase difference δ across a current-biased Josephson tunnel junction. The behavior of δ was deduced from measurements of the escape rate Γ of the junction from its zero-voltage state. The relevant parameters of the junction, that is, its critical current and shunting admittance, were determined in situ in the thermal regime from the dependence of Γ on bias current and from resonant activation in the presence of microwaves. It was found that the shunting capacitance was dominated by the self-capacitance of the junction while the shunting conductance was dominated by the bias circuitry. For an underdamped junction in the quantum regime, Γ became independent of temperature at low temperatures with a value that, with no adjustable parameters, was in excellent agreement with predictions for macroscopic quantum tunneling at T=0. When the critical current was reduced with a magnetic field so that the junction remained in the thermal regime at low temperatures, Γ followed the predictions of the thermal model, thereby showing the influence of extraneous noise to be negligible. In a further series of experiments, the existence of quantized energy levels in the potential well of the junction was demonstrated spectroscopically. The positions of the energy levels agreed quantitatively with quantum-mechanical predictions involving junction parameters measured in the thermal regime. The relative heights and widths of the resonances are in reasonable agreement with the predictions of a simple model.},

Several methods are known which achieve this goal, namely standard quantum-process tomography {(SQPT)}, ancilla-assisted process tomography, and the recently proposed scheme of direct characterization of quantum dynamics {(DCQD).} Here, we review these schemes and analyze them with respect to some of the physical resources they require. Although a reliable figure-of-merit for process characterization is not yet available, our analysis can provide a benchmark which is necessary for choosing the scheme that is the most appropriate in a given situation, with given resources. As a result, we conclude that for quantum systems where two-body interactions are not naturally available, {SQPT} is the most efficient scheme. However, for quantum systems with controllable two-body interactions, the {DCQD} scheme is more efficient than other known quantum-process tomography schemes in terms of the total number of required elementary quantum operations.},

For realistic parameters of superconducting qubits, this strategy reduces the error by an order of magnitude relative to the state of the art, all based on smooth and feasible pulse shapes.

The emission power is found to increase as the square of the number of junctions reaching values of 0.5 microwatt at frequencies up to 0.85 {THz}, and persists up to ∼50 kelvin.

With the new architecture, we demonstrate that Josephson junction qubits are highly coherent, with T2∼10 to 20 μs without the use of spin echo, and highly stable, showing no evidence for 1/f critical current noise.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.4948},
	abstract = {Quantum computers promise to solve certain problems exponentially faster than possible classically but are challenging to build because of their increased susceptibility to errors. Remarkably, however, it is possible to detect and correct errors without destroying coherence by using quantum error correcting codes [1]. The simplest of these are the three-qubit codes, which map a one-qubit state to an entangled three-qubit state and can correct any single phase-flip or bit-flip error of one of the three qubits, depending on the code used [2]. Here we demonstrate both codes in a superconducting circuit by encoding a quantum state as previously shown [3,4], inducing errors on all three qubits with some probability, and decoding the error syndrome by reversing the encoding process. This syndrome is then used as the input to a three-qubit gate which corrects the primary qubit if it was flipped. As the code can recover from a single error on any qubit, the fidelity of this process should decrease only quadratically with error probability. We implement the correcting three-qubit gate, known as a conditional-conditional {NOT} {(CCNot)} or Toffoli gate, using an interaction with the third excited state of a single qubit, in 63 ns. We find 85{\textbackslash}pm1\% fidelity to the expected classical action of this gate and 78{\textbackslash}pm1\% fidelity to the ideal quantum process matrix. Using it, we perform a single pass of both quantum bit- and phase-flip error correction with 76{\textbackslash}pm0.5\% process fidelity and demonstrate the predicted first-order insensitivity to errors. Concatenating these two codes and performing them on a nine-qubit device would correct arbitrary single-qubit errors. When combined with recent advances in superconducting qubit coherence times [5,6], this may lead to scalable quantum technology.},

	abstract = {Local realism is the idea that objects have definite properties whether or not they are measured, and that measurements of these properties are not affected by events taking place sufficiently far away. Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen used these reasonable assumptions to conclude that quantum mechanics is incomplete. Starting in 1965, Bell and others constructed mathematical inequalities whereby experimental tests could distinguish between quantum mechanics and local realistic theories. Many experiments have since been done that are consistent with quantum mechanics and inconsistent with local realism. But these conclusions remain the subject of considerable interest and debate, and experiments are still being refined to overcome 'loopholes' that might allow a local realistic interpretation. Here we have measured correlations in the classical properties of massive entangled particles {(9Be+} ions): these correlations violate a form of Bell's inequality. Our measured value of the appropriate Bell's 'signal' is 2.25 0.03, whereas a value of 2 is the maximum allowed by local realistic theories of nature. In contrast to previous measurements with massive particles, this violation of Bell's inequality was obtained by use of a complete set of measurements. Moreover, the high detection efficiency of our apparatus eliminates the so-called 'detection' loophole.},

	abstract = {Protecting the dynamics of coupled quantum systems from decoherence by the environment is a key challenge for solid-state quantum information processing1, 2. An idle quantum bit (qubit) can be efficiently insulated from the outside world by dynamical decoupling3, as has recently been demonstrated for individual solid-state qubits4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. However, protecting qubit coherence during a multi-qubit gate is a non-trivial problem3, 10, 11: in general, the decoupling disrupts the interqubit dynamics and hence conflicts with gate operation. This problem is particularly salient for hybrid systems12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, in which different types of qubit evolve and decohere at very different rates. Here we present the integration of dynamical decoupling into quantum gates for a standard hybrid system, the electron–nuclear spin register. Our design harnesses the internal resonance in the coupled-spin system to resolve the conflict between gate operation and decoupling. We experimentally demonstrate these gates using a two-qubit register in diamond operating at room temperature. Quantum tomography reveals that the qubits involved in the gate operation are protected as accurately as idle qubits. We also perform Grover’s quantum search algorithm1, and achieve fidelities of more than 90\% even though the algorithm run-time exceeds the electron spin dephasing time by two orders of magnitude. Our results directly allow decoherence-protected interface gates between different types of solid-state qubit. Ultimately, quantum gates with integrated decoupling may reach the accuracy threshold for fault-tolerant quantum information processing with solid-state devices1, 11.},

	abstract = {Electromagnetic signals are always composed of photons, although in the circuit domain those signals are carried as voltages and currents on wires, and the discreteness of the photon's energy is usually not evident. However, by coupling a superconducting quantum bit (qubit) to signals on a microwave transmission line, it is possible to construct an integrated circuit in which the presence or absence of even a single photon can have a dramatic effect. Such a system1 can be described by circuit quantum electrodynamics {(QED)—the} circuit equivalent of cavity {QED}, where photons interact with atoms or quantum dots. Previously, circuit {QED} devices were shown to reach the resonant strong coupling regime, where a single qubit could absorb and re-emit a single photon many times2. Here we report a circuit {QED} experiment in the strong dispersive limit, a new regime where a single photon has a large effect on the qubit without ever being absorbed. The hallmark of this strong dispersive regime is that the qubit transition energy can be resolved into a separate spectral line for each photon number state of the microwave field. The strength of each line is a measure of the probability of finding the corresponding photon number in the cavity. This effect is used to distinguish between coherent and thermal fields, and could be used to create a photon statistics analyser. As no photons are absorbed by this process, it should be possible to generate non-classical states of light by measurement and perform qubit–photon conditional logic, the basis of a logic bus for a quantum computer.},

It will be shown that this algorithm performs an oracle search on a database of N items with {O(√N)} calls to the oracle, yielding a speedup similar to other quantum search algorithms.

This circuit has a special bias point where the Larmor frequency is, to first order, insensitive to fluctuations in the bias parameters—the charge of the box island and the phase of the large junction. At this optimal working point, the state of the qubit can be determined by dispersive measurements that probe the second derivative of the state energy with respect to these bias parameters. We use the quantronium phase degree of freedom to perform a nonlinear, dispersive measurement of its inductive response using bifurcation amplification. This dispersive readout projects the state of the qubit in a few nanoseconds, and its latching property allows us to record the resulting information in a few hundred nanoseconds. We have measured, using this technique, Rabi oscillations and Ramsey fringes with an improved signal-to-noise ratio and contrast.

Simulating magnetic materials in the vicinity of a quantum phase transition is computationally intractable on classical computers, owing to the extreme complexity arising from quantum entanglement between the constituent magnetic spins. Here we use a degenerate Bose gas of rubidium atoms confined in an optical lattice to simulate a chain of interacting quantum Ising spins as they undergo a phase transition. Strong spin interactions are achieved through a site-occupation to pseudo-spin mapping. As we vary a magnetic field, quantum fluctuations drive a phase transition from a paramagnetic phase into an antiferromagnetic phase. In the paramagnetic phase, the interaction between the spins is overwhelmed by the applied field, which aligns the spins. In the antiferromagnetic phase, the interaction dominates and produces staggered magnetic ordering. Magnetic domain formation is observed through both in situ site-resolved imaging and noise correlation measurements. By demonstrating a route to quantum magnetism in an optical lattice, this work should facilitate further investigations of magnetic models using ultracold atoms, thereby improving our understanding of real magnetic materials.},

We compile published results for fluctuations in the critical current of Josephson tunnel junctions fabricated with different technologies and a wide range in I0 and area A, and show that their values of {SI0(1} Hz) scale to within a factor of 3 of {[144(I0∕μA)2∕(A∕μm2)](pA)2∕Hz} at 4.2 K. We empirically extrapolate {SI01∕2(1} Hz) to lower temperatures using a scaling {T(K)∕4.2.} Using this result, we find that the predicted values of τϕ at 100 {mK} range from 0.8 to 12 μs, and are usually substantially longer than values measured experimentally at lower temperatures.},

	abstract = {The number of steps any classical computer requires in order to find the prime factors of an l-digit integer N increases exponentially with l, at least using algorithms known at present. Factoring large integers is therefore conjectured to be intractable classically, an observation underlying the security of widely used cryptographic codes. Quantum computers, however, could factor integers in only polynomial time, using Shor's quantum factoring algorithm. Although important for the study of quantum computers, experimental demonstration of this algorithm has proved elusive. Here we report an implementation of the simplest instance of Shor's algorithm: factorization of N = 15 (whose prime factors are 3 and 5). We use seven spin-1/2 nuclei in a molecule as quantum bits, which can be manipulated with room temperature liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. This method of using nuclei to store quantum information is in principle scalable to systems containing many quantum bits, but such scalability is not implied by the present work. The significance of our work lies in the demonstration of experimental and theoretical techniques for precise control and modelling of complex quantum computers. In particular, we present a simple, parameter-free but predictive model of decoherence effects in our system.},

	abstract = {We review the theory, fabrication, and implementation of the Josephson bifurcation amplifier {(JBA).} At the core of the {JBA} is a nonlinear oscillator based on a reactively shunted Josephson junction. A weak input signal to the amplifier couples to the junction critical current I0 and results in a dispersive shift in the resonator plasma frequency ωp. This shift is enhanced by biasing the junction with a sufficiently strong microwave current Irf to access the nonlinear regime where ωp varies with Irf. For a drive frequency ωd such that Ω = {2Q(1−ωd/ωp){\textgreater}}, the oscillator enters the bistable regime where two nondissipative dynamical states {OL} and {OH}, which differ in amplitude and phase, can exist. The sharp I0 dependent transition from {OL} to {OH} forms the basis for a sensitive digital threshold amplifier. In the vicinity of the bistable regime (Ω{\textless}), analog amplification of continuous signals is also possible. We present experimental data characterizing amplifier performance and discuss two specific applications—the readout of superconducting qubits (digital mode) and dispersive microwave magnetometry (analog mode).},

The time-scale of this "instantaneous" process can be stretched using weak measurements so that it takes the form of a gradual random walk towards a final state. Remarkably, the interim measurement record is sufficient to continuously track and steer the quantum state using feedback. We monitor the dynamics of a resonantly driven quantum two-level system -- a superconducting quantum bit --using a near-noiseless parametric amplifier. The high-fidelity measurement output is used to actively stabilize the phase of Rabi oscillations, enabling them to persist indefinitely. This new functionality shows promise for fighting decoherence and defines a path for continuous quantum error correction.},

The kinetic inductance exhibited by superconducting transmission lines provides an example of a Kerr-like nonlinearity that is accompanied by a nonlinear resistance of the two-photon absorptive type. Such nonlinear dissipation can degrade the performance of amplifiers and mixers employing a Kerr-like nonlinearity as the gain or mixing medium. As an aid for parametric-amplifier design, the authors provide a quantum analysis of a cavity parametric amplifier employing a Kerr nonlinearity that is accompanied by a two-photon absorptive loss. Because of their usefulness in diagnostics, we obtain expressions for the pump amplitude within the cavity, the reflection coefficient for the pump amplitude reflected off of the cavity, the parametric gain, and the intermodulation gain. Expressions by which the degree of squeezing can be computed are also presented. Although the focus here is on providing aids for the design of kinetic-inductance parametric amplifiers, much of what is presented is directly applicable to analogous optical and mechanical amplifiers.},
