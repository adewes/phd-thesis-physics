\chapter{Theoretical Foundations}

The goal of this chapter is to provide the theoretical foundations needed to interpret and analyze the experiments discussed in the following chapters. We will therefore briefly introduce some basic concepts of quantum mechanics and quantum computing, discuss Transmon qubits and circuit quantum electrodynamics (CQED) and introduce the reader to the Josephson bifurcation amplifier that we use to read out the qubit state in our experiments. Further details on all the elements discussed here will be provided in the relevant sections of the ``Experiments'' chapter.
