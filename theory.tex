\chapter{Theoretical Foundations} \label{chapter:theory}

In this chapter we provide the reader with the minimum conceptual background and theoretical building blocks necessary  to understand this thesis work, which will be then presented in the following chapters. We begin our discussion with a general overview of classical and quantum information processing with a Turing machine, followed by an introduction to superconducting quantum circuits. We summarize the method to quantize electrical circuits and apply it to Cooper pair box devices, and in particular to the Transmon that will be used to implement the qubit register of our quantum processor. We then present coplanar waveguide resonators, and introduce circuit quantum electrodynamics on the example of a transmon coupled to a such a resonator. Finally, we consider the case of a nonlinear resonator used as a Josephson bifurcation amplifier since we will use such a readout device in our processor architecture.

By definition, computing designates the activity of using computer hardware and software to process information, or {\it data}. Classical information processing can be divided in so-called {\it analog and digital information processing}, the former being based on continuously changeable physical quantities whereas the latter is based on incrementally changeable quantities. The fundamental unit of digital information processing is the so-called {\it bit}, which represents a boolean (true/false) information. The discipline of theoretical computer science has been created to investigate the fundamental limits and properties of classical information processing. One of the main foundational theorems of theoretical computer science is the so-called {\it Church-Turing thesis} which provides a universal computing model by saying (basically) that everything which is computable can be efficiently computed using a {\it Turing machine}. Such a Turing machine, in turn, is a simple theoretical device which is able to run programs that operate on a discrete set of data using a well-specified set of operations. The Turing machine is universal in the sense that any other classical computing device can be efficiently emulated using a Turing machine with the appropriate program and data.

\smallskip

In the early 1980, Richard Feynman discovered that a classical Turing machine as described above would be unable to efficiently simulate a quantum-mechanical system \citep{feynman_simulating_1982}. He introduced the concept of a {\it quantum Turing machine} that would be able to simulate quantum-mechanical systems in an efficient manner. A few years later, David Deutsch took up Feynman's idea and developed an information processing framework based on quantum mechanics \citep{deutsch_quantum_1985}, coining the terms {\it quantum computing} and {\it quantum information processing}. He showed that by making use of different properties of quantum mechanics, namely, the superposition principle and entanglement, one could solve certain mathematical problems faster than possible with any classical computer \citep{deutsch_quantum_1985}. The work by Deutsch created a large interest in the physics community and led to a huge theoretical and experimental effort aimed at realizing an operational quantum computer and developing quantum algorithms for relevant real-world problems.

\section{Principles of "Conventional" Quantum Computing}

The first scheme imagined for quantum information processing is directly inspired from the classical digital Turing machine: information is stored in a set of quantum two level systems, the {\it quantum bits} or {\it qubits}, forming a quantum register, which is manipulated by sequentially applying unitary (and possibly non-unitary) operators to subsets --typically one or two-- of qubits in the register. As for a classical Turing machine, any arbitrary operation of this quantum processor can be decomposed as a sequence of gate operations chosen from a surprisingly small set of gates, said universal. The power of such a machine comes from the gates operating on superposed states, which provides an intrinsic parallelism in the processing.
\smallskip
This {\it quantum gate} approach to quantum computing is the method relevant to the present thesis work, and we will ignore other approaches introduced more recently such as {\it one-way quantum computing} \citep{raussendorf_one-way_2001}, {\it adiabatic quantum computing} \citep{farhi_quantum_2000} or {\it topological quantum computing} \citep{kitaev_fault-tolerant_2003}. In this section we introduce very briefly quantum bits and quantum gates, as well as some examples of quantum algorithms that are relevant to this work.


\subsection{Quantum Bits and registers}

As in classical computing, one can define in quantum computing a fundamental unit of information: the qubit. Such a qubit is a quantum-mechanical two-level system that can be put in any superposition
%
\begin{equation}
\ket{\psi} = \cos{\frac{\theta}{2}}\ket{0}+e^{i\phi}\sin{\frac{\theta}{2}}\ket{1}
\end{equation}
%
of its two level states $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$.
As can be seen, any state can be described by a pair of real numbers $\theta$ and $\phi$ that characterize the amplitude of each of the two basis states and the phase between them. A useful and intuitive representation of such a single-qubit state is the so-called {\it Bloch sphere representation}, shown in fig. \ref{fig:BlochSphere}. In this representation, any pure state $\ket{\psi}$ is located on a unit sphere. The north and south poles of this sphere correspond by convention to the qubit states $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$ (or vice and versa). All states lying on the sphere between those two correspond to superposition states, which are characterized by their ``latitude'' and ``azimuth'' angles $\theta$ and $\phi$. 
\smallskip
If the qubit state is not pure but is a mixed state given by the complete set of probabilities ${p_{i}}$ to find it in one of the pure states  ${\ket{psi_{i}}}$, it is also characterized by the density matrix $\rho_{mixed} = \sum\limits_i p_i \rho_i$ with $\rho_i=\ket{psi_{i}}\bra{psi_{i}}=$ the density matrix of pure state ${p_{i}}$. These $\rho$'s are hermitian $2\times 2$ matrix with non negative eigenvalues and writes
%
\begin{equation}
\rho = \left( \begin{array}{cc} \rho_{00} & \rho_{01} \\ \rho_{01}^* & \rho_{11} \end{array} \right),
\end{equation}
%
in the ${\ket{0},\ket{1}}$ basis, with $\rho_{00}$ and $\rho_{11}$ being real numbers and $\rho_{01}$ a complex number such that $\mathrm{Tr}\{\rho\}=1$, and $\rho=\rho^2$ for a pure state only. The expectation values $<A>$ of any operator $A$ is then given by $Tr(\rho A)$. A mixed state $\rho$ can also be represented in the Bloch sphere by the Bloch vector ${<sigma_x>,<sigma_y>,<sigma_z>}$, where $\sigma_x$, $\sigma_y$ and $\sigma_z$ are the three Pauli spin operators
%
\begin{align}
  \sigma_x  =  \left( \begin{array}{cc} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{array} \right)
  & & \sigma_y  =  \left( \begin{array}{cc} 0 & -i \\ i  &  0\end{array} \right)
  & & \sigma_z  =  \left( \begin{array}{cc} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{array} \right).
\label{eq:pauli_operators}
\end{align}
% 
The length of this vector decreases from 1 for a pure state down to 0 for a completely mixed state.

\smallskip

Quantum states with more than one qubit cannot be described anymore using Bloch spheres but are easily described with density matrices of dimension $2^n\otimes 2^n$ in the computational basis $\ket{q_1\hdots q_n}=\ket{q_1}\otimes\ket{q_{2}}\hdots\otimes\ket{q_n}$.For example, a two-qubit Bell state of the form $\ket{\psi_+}=1/\sqrt{2}(\ket{01}+\ket{10})$ can be written as
%
\begin{equation}
\rho_{\psi_+} = \frac{1}{2}\left( \begin{array}{cccc} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{array} \right)
\end{equation}
%
whereas a completely mixed state of 50 \% $\ket{01}$ and 50 \% $\ket{10}$ is represented by the matrix
%
\begin{equation}
\rho_{\psi_+} = \frac{1}{2}\left( \begin{array}{cccc} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{array} \right)
\end{equation}
%

\subsection{Quantum Gates}

Analogously to classical information processing one defines {\it quantum gates} that act on individual or multiple qubits and allow us to process information with them. Such a quantum gate can be described as a unitary operator acting on a part of the Hilbert space representing the qubit register. Theoretically there is an infinite number of possible quantum gates, however in order to describe all possible quantum operations that can be performed on a qubit register of arbitrary length it is sufficient to defined a so-called {\it universal set of quantum gates}. Such a set contains a small number of quantum gates that can, by concatenation, produce any arbitrary unitary quantum operator, as shown by the so-called {\it Solovay-Kitaev theorem} \citep{nielsen_quantum_2000,dawson_solovay-kitaev_2005}. Such a universal gate set that will be especially relevant to this work consists of the three single-qubit rotation matrices
%
\begin{eqnarray}
   R_x(\theta)  & = & e^{-i\sigma_x\frac{\phi_x}{2}} \\ 
   R_y(\theta)  & = & e^{-i\sigma_y\frac{\phi_y}{2}} \\ 
   R_z(\theta)  & = & e^{-i\sigma_z\frac{\phi_z}{2}} 
\label{eq:universal_single_qubit_gates}
\end{eqnarray}
%
togehter with the so-called $\sqrt{i\mathrm{SWAP}}$ two-qubit operator, which has the representation
%
\begin{equation}
\sqrt{i\mathrm{SWAP}} = \left( \begin{array}{cccc} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1/\sqrt{2} & i/\sqrt{2} & 0 \\ 0 & i/\sqrt{2} & 1/\sqrt{2} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1  \end{array}  \right)_{(\ket{00},\ket{01},\ket{10},\ket{11})}
\end{equation}
%
This universal set it not minimal, since in principle two single-qubit gates with a fixed rotation angle (e.g. $R_x(\pi/4)$ and $R_y(\pi/4)$) together with a universal two-qubit gate would be sufficient to form a universal set of quantum gates \citep{dawson_solovay-kitaev_2005}, however it is often advantageous if one can use single-qubit rotations with arbitary rotation angles around all three axes of the Bloch sphere since it can significantly reduce the number of gates required to implement a desired unitary operator.

\subsection{Quantum Algorithms}

The interest in quantum computing is mainly due to the fact that certain problems can be solved faster on a quantum computer than on a classical computer. By faster we mean here that the order $\cal{O}$ of the runtime of the algorithm increases faster on a classical computer than on a quantum computer as a function of the problem size, i.e. the number of bits needed to encode the problem. Up to this day it has not been demonstrated that a quantum computer can perform all tasks faster than a classical computer. However, a small number of real-world problems have been found that can be solved exponentially to polynomially faster on a quantum computer. Here we cite only the two most ``famous'' ones:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{The Shor Factorization Algorithm} Developed by Peter Shor in 1994 \citep{shor_algorithms_1994,shor_polynomial-time_1995}. This algorithm can factorize a binary number of length $N$ into its prime factors in $\begin{mathcal}O\end{mathcal}(\log^3{N})$ steps, therefore exponentially outperforming any known classical factorization algorithm. There is large interest in this algorithm since products of large prime numbers are routinely used in asymmetric cryptography.
\item \textbf{The Grover Search Algorithm}: Discovered by Lov Grover in 1996 \citep{grover_fast_1996}, this search algorithm can find a single well-defined state in an unsorted database of size $N$ in $\begin{mathcal}O\end{mathcal}(\sqrt{N})$ steps, being hence quadratically faster than a classical search algorithm.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Quantum Simulation}

Another domain of interest for quantum computers is so called {\it quantum simulation}. Here the goal is to simulate the behaviour of an arbitrary quantum system using a quantum computer by either engineering the quantum computer in direct analogy with the system being modeled (so called {\it analog quantum simulation}) or by numerically simulating the Hamiltonian of the quantum system on a general-purpose quantum computer (so-called {\it digital quantum simulation}). Since no classical computer can simulate a quantum system efficiently, there is a large interest in quantum simulation, especially in the fields of biology, chemistry and many-body physics.

\subsection{Realization of a Quantum Computer}

To realize a working quantum computer it is necessary to implement highly coherent qubits that can be manipulated, read out and coupled with high fidelity. So far, no fully working quantum computer has been experimentally demonstrated. However, larger progress towards the realization of such a quantum machine has been achieved in the last decade. Promising approaches for the realization of a quantum computer include --among others-- ions trapped in magnetic and electric fields \citep{monroe_demonstration_1995,cirac_quantum_1995}, nuclear magnetic resonance of organic molecules \citep{jones_nmr_2001,vandersypen_experimental_2001}, cold atomic gases \citep{briegel_quantum_2000}, photonic circuits \citep{knill_scheme_2001}, semiconductor circuits \citep{loss_quantum_1998} and, last but not least, superconducting circuits. Since this work treats only superconducting qubits of the Transmon type we focus our attention on them in the following sections. We explain how we can realize a reliable qubit using superconducting structures and how we can implement circuits to manipulate, couple and read out the qubit state.

\section{Superconducting Quantum Circuits}

In this section we discuss several types of superconducting circuit elements that are most relevant to this work. First, we will introduce the reader to the Josephson junction, which is the device we use to realize superconducting qubits and amplifiers. Afterwards, we discuss the properties of transmission lines and tranmission line resonators that we use extensively for implementing readout and coupling elements in our qubit design. Then, we present a general method for the quantization of arbitrary electrical circuits that we will use afterwards to perform canonical quantization of our circuits. We will use this method to derive the Hamiltonian of the Cooper pair box and treat the Transmon qubit as a special case. Then we will give a short overview of the field of circuit quantum electrodynamics and finally introduce the reader to the Josephson and cavity bifurcation amplifiers that we use for our qubit readout.

\subsection{The Josephson junction}

The core element used to construct quantum circuits is the so-called {\it Josephson junction}, being equivalent in significance to the transitor in classical circuits. A Josephson junction is based on the so-called Josephson effect \citep{josephson_possible_1962}, which states that between two superconductors connected through a {\it weak link}, a supercurrent
%
\begin{equation}
I = I_c\sin{\varphi}
\end{equation}
%
will flow, depending on the difference $\varphi = \varphi_2-\varphi_1$ between the gauge-invariant superconducting phases $\varphi_1$ and $\varphi_2$ at each side of the link. $\varphi$ is related to the voltage between the electrodes of the Junction as
%
\begin{equation}
U = \frac{\Phi_0}{2\pi}\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial t}
\end{equation}
%
where $\Phi_0 =h/2e \approx 2.05\times 10^{-15}\;\mathrm{Wb}$ is the so-called {\it magnetic flux quantum}. These two simple equations yield a system exhibiting a  wealth of interesting physical phenomena which are used today in various applications. The energy associated with the Josephson junction is given as
%
\begin{equation}
E = E_J(1-\cos{\varphi})
\end{equation}
%
where $E_J = I_c \Phi_0/2\pi$ is the so-called {\it Joesephson energy}. In addition to this Josephson energy, the junction usually has an energy associated to its capacitance (formed by its two seperated electrodes) given as $E_c = Q^2/2C$, with $Q$ being the charge accumulated on each of the electrodes of the junction.

\smallskip

For currents $I\ll I_c$, the Josephson junction behaves approximatively like a nonlinear inductance with
%
\begin{equation}
L_J(\varphi) = \frac{\Phi_0}{2\pi I_c \cos{\varphi}} \approx L_{J0}\left[1+\frac{\varphi^2}{2}+\begin{mathcal}O\end{mathcal}(\varphi^4)\right],\label{eq:josephson_inductance}
\end{equation}
%
where $L_{J0}=\Phi_0/2\pi I_c$. 

\smallskip

Using the potential and capacitive energies of the Josephson junction, we can formulate the quantum Hamiltonian of the device, which is
%
\begin{equation}
\hat{H} = \frac{1}{2C}\hat{Q}^2+E_J(1-\cos{\hat{\varphi}}),
\end{equation}
%
where $\hat{Q}$ and $\hat{\varphi}$ are conjugate quantum operators that, in analogy to a classical pendulum, play the role of position and momentum for the Josephson junction. In the limit of small angles $\varphi$, the Hamiltonian becomes that of a quantum LC oscillator. The nonlinearity present in the system is a key ingredient for realizing a Josephson junction qubit since it makes it possible to drive transitions between the first two quantum states of the device without also exciting higher quantum states, as would be the case for a quantum harmonic oscillator.

\subsection{Quantization of Electrical Circuits}

In this section we will outline a general method to treat arbitary electrical circuits as the ones discussed before within the framework of quantum-mechanics, hence {\it quantizing} them. This introduction on circuit quantization presented in this chapter is based on an seminal article by M. Devoret \cite{devoret_quantum_1995}. A more specific example of circuit quantization can be found in \citep{burkard_multilevel_2004}.

\begin{SCfigure}
	\includegraphics[width=5cm]{"./material/figures/introduction/sample_circuit"}
	\caption{An exemplatory superconducing circuit made of a Josephson junction, an inductor, a capacitor and a voltage source. The circuit topology can be described by two nodes (including ground) or three branches.}
	\label{fig:SampleCircuit}
\end{SCfigure}

Fig. \ref{fig:SampleCircuit} shows an exemplatory circuit made of an inductance, a capacitor, a Josephson junction and a voltage source. A circuit as this one is fully characterized by the parameters of its elements and its toplogy. The latter can be described -- following the laws of Kirchhoff -- as a set of nodes $j$ connected by a number of branches $i$ . In classical circuit theory, each branch is described by a voltage $V_i$ between its ends and a current $I_{i}$ flowing through it. The Kirchhoff laws demand that the sum of the branch voltages $V_i$ along any closed path must be zero and that the sum of currents flowing in and out of each node must be zero. For the quantization of electrical circuits it is usually more convenient to replace voltages and currents with branch charges and fluxes that are defined as
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\Phi_i(t) & = & \int\limits_{-\infty}^t V_i(t') dt' \\
Q_i(t) & = & \int\limits_{-\infty}^t I_i(t') dt'
\end{eqnarray}
%
For these branch charges and fluxes we can define two Kirchoff laws
%
\begin{align}
\sum\limits_{i} Q_i  =  Q_c & & , & & \sum\limits_{i}\Phi_i = \Phi_c \label{eq:kirchhoff_charge}
\end{align}
%
where $Q_c$ and $\Phi_c$ are constants and where the first sum includes charges $Q_i$ of all elements connected to a certain node and the second one contains all fluxes $\Phi_i$ around a closed path of the circuit. We can obtain a complete set of node and branch equations for any given circuit by constructing the so-called {\it spanning tree} of the circuit \citep{devoret_quantum_1995}. To quantize such a circuit made up of non-dissipative elements we can follow the method given in \cite{yurke_quantum_1984}, writing the Lagrangian of the circuit as 
%
\begin{equation}
\begin{mathcal}L\end{mathcal} = \sum\limits_i \begin{mathcal}V\end{mathcal}_i - \sum\limits_i \begin{mathcal}T\end{mathcal}_i
\end{equation}
%
where $\begin{mathcal}V\end{mathcal}_i$ and $\begin{mathcal}T\end{mathcal}_i$ are the potential and kinetic energies associated to each circuit element. For a circuit composed entirely of capacitors and inductors, this Lagrangian is given as
%
\begin{equation}
\begin{mathcal}L\end{mathcal}(\Phi_1,\hdots,\Phi_n,\dot{\Phi}_1,\hdots,\dot{\Phi}_n) = \frac{1}{2}\sum\limits_i C_i \dot{\Phi}_i^2-\frac{1}{2}\sum\limits_i \frac{\Phi_i^2}{L_i} \label{eq:circuit_lagrangian}
\end{equation}
%
If needed, resistors can be described within the Lagrangian formalism by modeling them as semi-infinite transmission lines with a characteristic impedance matching their resistance \citep{yurke_quantum_1984}. We can also include general nonlinear capacitances and inductances that obey the relations $\dot{\Phi}=f_C(Q)$ and $\dot{Q}=g_L(\Phi)$ between their node flux and charge, whose energies are given as
%
\begin{eqnarray}
E_C = \int\limits_0^Q f_C(Q)dQ \\
E_L = \int\limits_0^\Phi g_L(\Phi)d\Phi
\end{eqnarray}
%
A Josephson junction, for example, can be described as a nonlinear inductance with $g_L^{JJ}(\Phi)=I_c\sin{(2\pi\Phi/\Phi_0)}$, having an associated energy
%
\begin{equation}
E_L^{JJ} = \int\limits_0^\Phi I_c\sin{\left(2\pi\Phi/\Phi_0\right)}=E_J(1-\cos{\left[2\pi\frac{\Phi}{\Phi_0}\right]}),
\end{equation}
%
where $E_J = I_c\Phi_0/2\pi$. Tranmission lines can be quantized by a similar approach, as shown e.g. in \citep{yurke_quantum_1984}. Externally imposed charges and fluxes can be modeled as ``pre-charged'' capacitors and inductors with infinite charge or flux and infinite capacitance or inductane that get renormalized at the end of the quantization process \citep{devoret_quantum_1995}. Externally imposed voltages and currents can be treated like this as well by using their corresponding fluxes and charges. From the Lagrangian as given by eq. (\ref{eq:circuit_lagrangian}) we obtain then the equations of motion of the system by variation of the action
%
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left( \frac{\partial \begin{mathcal}L\end{mathcal}}{\partial\dot{\Phi}_i}\right)-\frac{\partial \begin{mathcal}L\end{mathcal}}{\partial \Phi_i} = 0
\end{equation}
%
Finally, by imposing the charge-conservation equations as given by eq. (\ref{eq:kirchhoff_charge}) we obtain a complete description of the underlying circuit. From the variable $\Phi_i$ we obtain the canonically conjugate momentum $Q_i$ by the equation
%
\begin{equation}
Q_i = \frac{\partial \begin{mathcal}L\end{mathcal}}{\partial(\dot{\Phi}_i)}, \label{eq:canonical_momentum}
\end{equation}
%
where $\dot{\Phi}_i=d\Phi_i/dt$. Having obtained $\Phi_i$ and $Q_i$, we can calculate the Hamiltonian $\begin{mathcal}H\end{mathcal}$ of the system by applying the transformation
%
\begin{equation}
\begin{mathcal}H\end{mathcal}(\Phi_1,\hdots,\Phi_n,Q_1,\hdots,Q_n) = \sum\limits_j \dot{\Phi}_i Q_i - \begin{mathcal}L\end{mathcal}(\Phi_1,\hdots,\Phi_n,\dot{\Phi}_1,\hdots,\dot{\Phi}_n) \label{eq:l_to_h}
\end{equation}
%
This Hamiltonian, written in generalized coordinates, yields the full quantum-mechanical equation of motion of the electrical circuit and depends only on the canonically conjugate variables $\Phi_{1},\hdots,\Phi_n$ and $Q_1,\hdots,Q_n$. First Quantization of the circuit variables can then be done by imposing commutation relations between the set of canonical variables $\Phi_i$ and $Q_i$ such that
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\left[Q_i(t),Q_j(t')\right] & = & 0 \\
\left[\Phi_i(t),\Phi_j(t') \right] & = & 0 \\
\left[\Phi_i(t),Q_i(t')\right] & = & i\hbar\delta_{ij}\delta(t-t') \label{eq:quantization_commutation_relations}
\end{eqnarray}
%


\subsection{The Cooper Pair Box}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{"./material/figures/introduction/cooper_pair_box"}
	\caption{a) The circuit schematic of a Cooper Pair Box (CPB). The device consists of a Josephson junction capacitively coupled to a voltage source. The extra capacitance of the Josephson junction is modeled by a capacitor $C_\Sigma$. Charges can accumulate on the island between the voltage source and the Josephson junction. b) shows a so-called {\it split Cooper pair box}, where instead of one junction two of them are arranged in a loop. With this geometry it is possible to tune the effective Josephson energy of the circuit by changing the magnetic flux inside the junction loop. c) The schematic of a split CPB capacitively coupled to ground. This schematic corresponds most closely to the experimental CPB circuit that we use in this work.}
	\label{fig:cpb_circuit}
\end{figure}

The {\it Cooper pair box (CPB)} is a device containing a Josephson junction coupled to an input voltage source through a gate capacitance $C_g$, as shown in fig. \ref{fig:cpb_circuit}a. Often one also uses two junction in a loop instead of one single one, as shown in fig. \ref{fig:cpb_circuit}b, which allows one to tune the effective Josephson energy of the system by changing the flux inside the junction loop, as will be explained in more detail later. The CPB circuit consists of  three nodes (including ground) and two (three for the two-junction case) branches. The flux $\Phi_2$ is not really independent since it is set by the voltage source $V_g$, so we can directly eliminate it from the equations. This leaves us with only one remaining active node with a flux $\Phi_1$. Using these definitions, the Lagrangian of the circuit is given as
%
\begin{equation}
\begin{mathcal}L\end{mathcal}=\frac{1}{2}C_\Sigma\dot{\Phi}_1^2+\frac{1}{2}C_g\left(\dot{\Phi}_1+V_g\right)^2-E_J\left(1-\cos{2\pi\Phi_1/\tilde{\Phi}_0}\right)
\end{equation}
%
where we have written the magnetic flux quantum as $\tilde{\Phi}_0$ to distinguish it from the flux at the ground node. The canonical momentum $Q_1$ associated to the flux $\Phi_1$ is given as
%
\begin{equation}
Q_1 = \frac{\partial \begin{mathcal}L\end{mathcal}}{\partial \dot{\Phi}_1} = C_\Sigma \dot{\Phi}_1+C_g(V_g+\dot{\Phi}_1) \label{eq:q_of_phi}
\end{equation}
%
From this, we can directly calculate the Hamiltonian by using eq. (\ref{eq:l_to_h}) and substituting $Q_1$ as given by eq. (\ref{eq:q_of_phi}) for $\dot{\Phi}_1$, which yields
%
\begin{equation}
\begin{mathcal}H\end{mathcal} = E_J\left(1-\cos{\left[2\pi\Phi_1/\tilde{\Phi}_0\right]}\right)+\frac{(Q_1-C_g V_g)^2}{2(C_\Sigma+C_g)}-\frac{1}{2}C_g V_g^2
\end{equation}
%
Quantization of the Hamiltonian is completed by replacing $Q_i\to \hat{Q}_i$ and $\Phi_i\to\hat{\Phi}_i$ and imposing the commutation relations given by eqs. (\ref{eq:quantization_commutation_relations}). If, in addition we introduce reduced operators for the charge $\hat{n}=\hat{Q}/2e$ and the phase $\hat{\phi_1}=2\pi\hat{\Phi_1}/\tilde{\Phi}_0$ and discard the energy stored in the voltage source (which is unrelevant), we obtain the Hamiltonian of the Cooper pair box, as formulated e.g. in the thesis of V. Bouchiat \citep{bouchiat_quantum_1998}
%
\begin{equation}
\hat{H} = E_C \left( \hat{n} - n_g\right)^2-E_J \cos{\hat{\phi_1}}. \label{eq:cpb_hamiltonian}
\end{equation}
%

Here, $E_C = (2e)^2 / (C_\Sigma+C_g)$ as the charging energy of the Cooper pair box and $n_g=V_g C_g /2e $ the reduced gate charge.

\smallskip

For the split Cooper pair box as shown in fig. \ref{fig:cpb_circuit}b, the treatment is slightly modified. First of all, we write the Josephson energies of the two junctions as $E_{J1}=(1+d)E_J/2$ and $E_{J2}=(1-d)E_J/2$, where $d$ is the energy asymmetry between the junctions. When imposing an external phase $\phi_{ext}=2\pi\Phi_{ext}/\tilde{\Phi}_0$ in the loop, the potential energy of the two junctions can be written as
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{mathcal}V\end{mathcal}_J & = & -\frac{E_J}{2}\left[(1+d)\cos{(\phi_1-\phi_{ext}/2)}+(1-d)\cos{(\phi_2+\phi_{ext}/2)} \right] \\
& = & -E_J\left[\cos{\phi_1}\cos{\frac{\phi_{ext}}{2}}+d\sin{\phi_1}\sin{\frac{\phi_{ext}}{2}}\right]
\end{eqnarray}
%
Usually, $\phi_{ext}$ can be regarded as a classical control parameter. The remaining part of the quanization process proceeds as above, yielding a Hamiltonian of the split Cooper pair box of the form
%
\begin{equation}
\hat{H}_{split} = E_C(\hat{n}-n_g)^2-E_J\left[\cos{\hat{\phi}_1}\cos{\frac{\phi_{ext}}{2}}+d\sin{\hat{\phi}_1}\sin{\frac{\phi_{ext}}{2}}\right]
\end{equation}
%
This Hamiltonian can be recast in the form \citep{cottet_implementation_2002}
%
\begin{equation}
\hat{H}_{split} = E_C(\hat{n}-n_g)^2-E_J'(d,\phi_{ext})\cos{[\hat{\phi}_1+\gamma(\phi_{ext})]},
\end{equation}
%
where
%
\begin{eqnarray}
E_J'(d,\phi_{ext}) & = & E_J\sqrt{\frac{1+d^2+(1-d^2)\cos{\phi_{ext}}}{2}} \\
\tan{\gamma(\phi_{ext})} & = & -d\tan{\frac{\phi_{ext}}{2}}
\end{eqnarray}
%
It is therefore possible to map the Hamiltonian of the split CPB to that of the single-junction one by defining $\hat{\theta}\to\hat{\phi}_1+\gamma(\phi_{ext})$ and $E_J\to E_J'(d,\phi_{ext})$. 

Using the Hamiltonian defined in eq. (\ref{eq:cpb_hamiltonian}) we can calculate the wavefunction of the simple Cooper pair box. The variables $\hat{n}$ and $\theta$ are conjugate such that $[\theta,\hat{n}]=-i\hbar$, the corresponding wavefunction $\Psi_k(\theta) = \bracket{\theta,k}$ will therefore satisfy a Schrödinger equation of the form
%
\begin{equation}
E_k \Psi_k(\theta) = E_C(\frac{1}{i}\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}-n_g)^2 \Psi_k(\theta) - E_J \cos{\left(\theta\right)}\Psi_k(\theta) \label{eq:cpb_schroedinger_equation}
\end{equation}
%
Since the potential $E_J\cos{(\theta)}$ is $2\pi$ periodic, the solution will be of the form
%
\begin{equation}
\Psi_k(\theta) = \Psi_k(\theta+2\pi),
\end{equation}
%
which allows us to map eq. (\ref{eq:cpb_schroedinger_equation}) to the so-called {\it Mathieu  equation}
%
\begin{equation}
\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+\left[a-2q\cos{(2x)}\right]y = 0
\end{equation}
%
The {\it Floquet theorem} states that all solutions to this equation can be written in the form
%
\begin{equation}
F(a,q,x) = \exp{\left(i\mu x\right)}P(a,q,x)
\end{equation}
%
The most general solutions of this equation are given as \citep{cottet_implementation_2002}
%
\begin{equation}
\Psi_k(r,q,\theta) = \mcal{C}_1\exp{\left(i n_g \theta \right)}\mcal{M}_C\left(\frac{4E_k}{E_C},-\frac{2E_J}{E_C},\frac{\theta}{2}\right)+\mcal{C}_2\exp{\left(i n_g \theta \right)}\mcal{M}_S \left(\frac{4 E_k}{E_C},-\frac{2 E_J}{E_C},\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
\end{equation}
%
with 
%
\begin{equation}
E_k = \frac{E_C}{4}\mcal{M}_A \left(r_k,-\frac{2 E_J}{E_C} \right)
\end{equation}
%
Here, $\mcal{M}_C$, $\mcal{M}_S$ are the so-called {\it Mathieu functions} and $\mcal{M}_A$ corresponds to the eigenvalue corresponding to each solution. Following the convention in \citep{cottet_implementation_2002} we order the $E_k$ such that the energy increases with increasing k, yielding \citep{koch_charge-insensitive_2007}
%
\begin{eqnarray}
r_k(n_g) & = & \sum\limits_{l\pm 1}\left[\mathrm{int}(n_g+l/2)\mathrm{mod}\;2\right] \notag \\
&  & \times\left\{\mathrm{int}(n_g/2)+l(-1)^k[(k+1)\mathrm{div}\;2]\right\}
\end{eqnarray}

	\label{fig:CooperPairBoxEnergies}
\end{figure}

We denote the energy differences between individual energy level by $E_{ij} = E_j - E_i$. We also define the absolute and relative anharmonicities of the first two energy levels as $\alpha \equiv E_{12}-E_{01}$ and $\alpha_r \equiv \alpha / E_{01}$. An in-depth treatment of the Cooper pair box can be found e.g. in \citep{cottet_implementation_2002}.

\subsection{The Transmon Qubit}

The Transmon qubit as developed in Yale by the Schoelkopf group \cite{koch_charge-insensitive_2007,wallraff_strong_2004} is a Cooper pair box operated in the regime where $E_J \gg E_C$. As shown in fig. \ref{fig:CooperPairBoxEnergies}, in this regime the charge dispersion of the energy levels of the Cooper pair box becomes almost flat, thus rendering the transition frequency $E_{01}$ practically insensitive to the value of the gate charge $n_g$. This reduced sensitivity to charge noise is highly advantageous in experiments since it increases the decoherence time of the qubit. However, when increasing the ratio $E_J/E_C$, we also reduce the anharmonicity $\alpha_r$ of the qubit, therefore limiting the speed of gate operations that can be realized with this system (driving errors related to weak anharmonicity will be discussed more thoroughly chapter \ref{chapter:processor_characterization}). In the limit $E_J \gg E_C$ these qubit anharmonicities are well approximated by $\alpha \simeq -E_C$ and $\alpha_r \simeq -(32 E_J / E_C)^{-1/2}$. However, $\alpha_r$ decreases only geometrically with $E_J/E_C$, whereas the sensitivity of the qubit to charge noise decreases exponentially with the ratio of Josephson and charging energy.

\subsection{Coplanar Waveguide Resonators}

\begin{SCfigure}
	\includegraphics[width=6cm]{"./material/figures/introduction/transmission_lines"}
	\caption{a) The circuit diagram of a grounded (coaxial) tranmission line. b) The circuit diagram of a grounded coplanar waveguide (CPW) tranmission line.}
	\label{fig:tline_schematic}
\end{SCfigure}

Another circuit element that we will encounter many times in this work is the so-called {\it coplanar waveguide resonator} (CPW), which we will use later to e.g. realize our single-shot qubit readout. A coplanar waveguide resonator can be treated in a more general way as a finite-length, terminated {\it transmission line}. In principle, such a transmission line is a structure with a large extension in one direction that is capable of transmitting electromagnetic waves along its extended dimension. The circuit symbol that we will use in this work for a transmission line is shown in fig. \ref{fig:tline_schematic}a. A coplanar waveguide is a flat structure with a central conductor that is seperated by a gap from a groundplane on either side, as shown in fig. \ref{fig:tline_schematic}b. A detailed treatment of the physics of tranmission lines can be found e.g. in \cite{pozar_microwave_2011}. For this introduction we will skip this basic treatment and start directly with the equation that describes the propagation of an electromagnetic wave along the extended dimension $z$ of the waveguide:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
V(z,t) & = & \exp{\left(i\omega t\right)}\cdot\left[V^+ \exp{\left(-i\gamma z\right)}+V^-\exp{\left(i\gamma z\right)}\right] \\
I(z,t) & = & \frac{1}{Z_0}\exp{\left(i\omega t\right)}\cdot\left[V^+ \exp{\left(-i\gamma z\right)}-V^-\exp{\left(i\gamma z\right)}\right].
\end{eqnarray}
%
Here, $\gamma = \alpha+i\beta = \sqrt{(R+i\omega L)(G+i\omega C)}$ is the so-called {\it propagation constant} which describes the dispersion and damping of electromagnetic waves along the waveguide and $\omega$ the circular frequency of the electromagnetic wave. The voltages $V^+$ and $V^-$ correspond to waves traveling in different directions along the waveguide.

\smallskip

If we regard now a waveguide of finite length $l$, we can model the voltages and currents at both ends are related through \citep{pozar_microwave_2011}
%
\begin{equation}
\left( \begin{array}{c} V_1 \\ I_1 \end{array}\right) = \left( 
		\begin{array}{cc}
			\cos{\gamma l} & iZ_r \cos{\gamma l} \\
			i Y_r \sin{\gamma l} & \cos{\gamma l}
		\end{array}
		\right) \cdot \left(
		\begin{array}{c}
			V_2 \\ I_2
		\end{array}
		\right), \label{eq:cpw_abcd_matrix}
\end{equation}
%
where $Z_R=\sqrt{\begin{mathcal}L/C\end{mathcal}}$ is the impedance of the waveguide and $Y_R=1/Z_R$ the corresponding admittance. One can easily create a resonator using such a finite-length coplanar waveguide. Here, we will discuss the open-ended $\lambda / 2$ CPW resonator that we use in our experiments to realize the qubit readout resonator. To realize the resonator, we terminate the transmission line at one end by an open gap and connect the other end to a drive line through an input capacitance $C_g$. We can make use of eq. (\ref{eq:cpw_abcd_matrix}) to calculate the end voltages and currents of the resonator,demanding that $I_2=0$ (since the resonator is open-ended). We obtain for the voltage $V_1$ and current $I_2$ the relation
%
\begin{eqnarray}
V_1 & = & \cos{\gamma l} V_2 \\
I_1 & = & i Y_r \sin{\gamma l} V_2
\end{eqnarray}
%
The impedance of the resonator is given as $V_1/I_1 = -i Z_R \cot{\gamma l}$. The input impedance of the resonator as seen through the gate capacitance $C_g$ is then
%
\begin{equation}
Z_{in} = -i Z_r \cot{\gamma l}-\frac{i}{\omega C_g} \label{eq:cpw_impedance}
\end{equation}
%
The $S_{11}$ reflection coefficient of the resonator when coupling it to an input line with impedance $Z_0$ is
%
\begin{equation}
S_{11} = \frac{Z_{in}-Z_0}{Z_{in}+Z_0} = \frac{i(Z_R\cot{\gamma l}+1/\omega C_g)-Z_0}{Z_0+i(Z_r\cot{\gamma l}-1/\omega C_g)}
\end{equation}
%
Now, when measuring the reflection of an incoming signal with voltage $V^+$ at frequency $f=2\pi \omega$ and phase $\phi_0$, the phase of the relected signal $\phi_{ref}$ will be simply given as $\phi_{ref}-\phi_0=\mathrm{Arg}[V^-/V^+] = \mathrm{Arg}[S_{11}]$. The amplitude of the reflected signal $|S_{11}|$ is always unity since we assumed that there are no internal losses inside the resonator. Fig \ref{fig:lambda_over_4_response} shows this phase along with the absolute value of the input impedance $|Z_{in}|$ for an exemplatory resonator, shown in reduced units of $[l/v]$, with impendances $Z_r=Z_0=50\;\mathrm{\Omega}$, $\alpha=0$ and $C_g=10^{-3}/\omega_0\;[\mathrm{Hz}\cdot \mathrm{F}]$, where $\omega_0 = 2\pi f_0$ is the angular resonance frequency of the resonator.

\begin{SCfigure}
	\includegraphics[width=10cm]{"./material/mathematica/cpw_lambda_over_4_phase_and_z"}
	\caption{The reflected phase and absolute value of the input impedance of a $\lambda/4$ resonator with $Z_r=Z_0=50\;\mathrm{\Omega}$, $\alpha=0$ and $C_g=10^{-3}/\omega_0\;[\mathrm{Hz}\cdot\mathrm{F}]$, plotted as a function of the reduced frequency.}
	\label{fig:lambda_over_4_response}
\end{SCfigure}

We can approximatively model the distributed CPW resonator as a lumped element $LC$ resonator, which is useful for e.g. calculating its quality factor. If we regard the input impedance of the resonator in the vicinity of $\omega_0$ such that $\Delta \omega = \omega -\omega_0 \ll \omega_0$ and $\beta l = \pi +\pi\Delta \omega /\omega_0$, we obtain an effective impedance
%
\begin{equation}
Z_{in} = -i\frac{Z_{r}}{(\Delta \omega \pi / \omega_0)}
\end{equation}
%
We can identify the quantities in this equation with the input impedance of a parallel LC-resonator, which is approximatively given as
%
\begin{equation}
Z_{in} = \frac{Z_0}{1+2i Q \Delta \omega / \omega_0}
\end{equation}
%
with $Q=\omega_0 RC$. This yields an effective inductance and capacitance for the transmission line resonator of
%
\begin{eqnarray}
L_{r} & = & \frac{1}{\omega_0^2 C} \\
C_{r} & = & \frac{\pi}{2\omega_0 Z_r}
\end{eqnarray}
%
When coupling this resonator to an input transmission line of impedance $Z_0$ through a  capacitance $C_g$ as before, the quality factor of the coupled (or {\it loaded}) resonator will be given as
%
\begin{equation}
Q_L = \omega_0^* \frac{C+C^*}{1/R_{r}+1/R^*}
\end{equation}
%
where we have introduced an effective resistance, capacitance and resonance frequency given as
%
\begin{eqnarray}
R^* & = & \frac{1+\omega_0^2 C_g^2 Z_0^2}{\omega_0^2 C_g^2 Z_0} \\
C^* & = & \frac{C_g}{1+\omega_0^2 C_g^2 Z_0^2} \\
\omega_0^* & = & \frac{1}{\sqrt{L_r(C_r+C_g)}}
\end{eqnarray}
%
We will make use of these relations and the fact that the external quality factor can be tuned by the value of the gate capacitance $C_g$ when designing the qubit readout resonator. 

\subsubsection{Quantization of the resonator}

We can quantize the coplanar waveguide resonator by following the recipe given in the last section. A detailed review of this quantization process can be found e.g. in \citep{yurke_quantum_1984}. If we are not interested in the internal mode structure of the resonator, it suffices to quantize the simple LC model of the CPW resonator. The Hamiltonian of the LC series resonator is
%
\begin{equation}
H = \frac{1}{2C}Q^2+\frac{1}{2L}\Phi^2
\end{equation}
%
It is completely equivalent to a harmonic oscillator, the quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian is therefore given as
%
\begin{equation}
\hat{H} = \omega\hbar\left(\hat{a}^\dagger\hat{a}+\frac{1}{2}\right)
\end{equation}
%
Here, $\omega=\sqrt{1/LC}$ and $\hat{a}^\dagger$ and $\hat{a}$ are so-called {\it creation and annihilation operators} that can be written in function of the flux $\hat{\Phi}$ and charge $\hat{Q}$ operators as
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{a}^\dagger & = & \sqrt{\frac{1}{2\hbar L \omega}}\left(\hat{\Phi}+iL\omega \hat{Q}\right)\\
\hat{a} & = & \sqrt{\frac{1}{2\hbar L\omega}}\left( \hat{\Phi}-iL\omega \hat{Q}\right)
\end{eqnarray}
%
By inverting these relations we obtain the flux and charge operators $\hat{\Phi}$ and $\hat{Q}$. Taking their time derivative gives us the voltage and current operators $\hat{V}$ and $\hat{I}$. These four operators are
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{\Phi} & = & \sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2C\omega}}\left(\hat{a}^\dagger+\hat{a}\right) \\
\hat{Q} & = & i\sqrt{\frac{C\omega\hbar}{2}}\left(\hat{a}^\dagger-\hat{a}\right) \\
\hat{V} & = & \sqrt{\frac{\hbar\omega}{2C}}\left(\hat{a}^\dagger+\hat{a}\right) \\
\hat{I} & = & i\omega\sqrt{\frac{C\omega\hbar}{2}}\left(\hat{a}^\dagger-\hat{a}\right)
\end{eqnarray}
%

\section{Circuit Quantum Electrodynamics}

\begin{SCfigure}

	\caption{a)Images of a $\lambda/2$ resonator, a Transmon qubit and its Josephson junctions. b) The equivalent circuit of the setup. c) The equivalent circuit using a lumped-element model for the $\lambda/2$ resonator.}
	\label{fig:CQED}
\end{SCfigure}


{\it Cavity quantum electrodynamics} is a research domain where one investigates the physics of an atom (or a large number of atoms) coupled to a high-Q microwave cavity. Analogously, {\it circuit quantum electrodynamics} investigates the coupling of an articial atom (e.g. a Transmon qubit) coupled to a microwave resonator. Usually, such a qubit-resonator system can be represented as in fig. \ref{fig:CQED}. There, a Transmon qubit is capacitively coupled to a $\lambda/2$ resonator which itself is capacitively coupled to an input tranmission line. The $\lambda/2$ resonator can be modeled as an harmonic oscillator when neglecting the internal mode structure, in which case it has the Hamiltonian
%
\begin{equation}
\hat{H}_r = \hbar(\omega_r+\frac{1}{2})\hat{a}^\dagger\hat{a}.
\end{equation}
%
Here, $\omega_r = 1/\sqrt{L_r C_r}$ gives the resonator frequency of the resonator. On the other hand, the Hamiltonian of the Transmon qubit can be written as a function of its basis states $\ket{i}$ as
%
\begin{equation}
\hat{H}_{q} = \hbar\sum\limits_i \omega_i \ket{i}\bra{i}
\end{equation}
%
where $\hbar\omega_i$ is the energy of the i-th level of the Transmon (and not the transition energy between different states). Due to the capacitance between the qubit and the resonator, a coupling energy of the form
%
\begin{equation}
\hat{H}_{rq} = \frac{1}{2}C_{g}\hat{V}_{qr}^2 = \frac{1}{2}C_g\left(V^0_{rms}(a^\dagger+a)-\hat{V}\right)^2
\end{equation}
%
arises, where $V_g$ is the voltage between the coupling capacitance $C_g$, $\hat{V}=2e/C_\Sigma \cdot(n_g-\hat{n})$ is the voltage between the Transmon electrodes and $V^0_{rms} = \sqrt{\hbar \omega_r/2C_r}$ is the root mean square voltage in the resonator. The coupling energy can be rewritten as
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{H}_{rq} & = & \frac{1}{2}C_g\left[V_{rms}^0(a^\dagger+a)-\frac{2e}{C_\Sigma}\left(n_g-\hat{n}\right)\right]^2 \notag \\
       & = & 2e \beta V_{rms}^0\hat{n}(a^\dagger+a) + \hdots \label{eq:cqed_coupling}
\end{eqnarray}
%
in the limit $\beta \ll C_\Sigma$, where we defined $\beta = C_g/C_\Sigma$. The terms ommitted in eq. (\ref{eq:cqed_coupling}) correspond to energy shifts of the qubit and the resonator which are not directly relevant for the coupling between them. 
 In the limit where the resonator capacity $C_r \gg C_\Sigma$, we can write the effective Hamiltonian of the qubit-resonator system using the uncoupled basis states $\ket{i}$ of the Transmon as
%
\begin{equation}
\hat{H} = \hbar \sum\limits_j \omega_j \ket{j}\bra{j} + \hbar \omega_r \hat{a}^\dagger \hat{a} + \hbar \sum\limits_{i,j} g_{ij} \ket{i}\bra{j}(\hat{a}+\hat{a}^\dagger) \label{eq:cqed_hamiltonian}
\end{equation}
%
Here, the coupling energies $g_{ij}$ are given as
%
\begin{equation}
\hbar g_{ij} = 2\beta e V_{rms}^0 \bra{i}\hat{n}\ket{j} = \hbar g_{ji}^*
\end{equation}
%
When the coupling between the resonator and the Transmon is weak, such that $g_{ij} \ll \omega_r,E_{01}/h$, we can ignore the terms in eq. (\ref{eq:cqed_hamiltonian}) that describe simultaneous excitation or deexcitation of the Transmon and the resonator and obtain the so-called {\it rotating wave approximation}, which is given as
%
\begin{equation}
\hat{H} = \hbar \sum\limits_j \omega_j \ket{j}\bra{j}+\hbar \omega_r \hat{a}^\dagger \hat{a} + \hbar \sum\limits_i g_{i,i+1}\left(\ket{i}\bra{i+1}\hat{a}^\dagger +\ket{i+1}\bra{i}\hat{a}\right) \label{eq:cqed_rotating_wave}
\end{equation}
%
This Hamiltonian describes thus a multi-level quantum system coupled to a resonator through a capacitive interaction. The first two terms correspond to the energies of the n-level system and the resonator, respectively. The term $\ket{i}\bra{i+1}\hat{a}^\dagger$ describes the creation of a photon in the resonator accompanied by the deexcitation of the n-level system by one energy level and the term $\ket{i+1}\bra{i}\hat{a}$ describes the opposite process.

\subsection{Dispersive Limit \& Qubit Readout}

When the qubit frequency is far detuned from the resonator frequency such that $|\omega_{ij}-\omega_r| \gg g_{ij}$, direct qubit-resonator interactions are almost completely supressed and only a dispersive shift of the transition frequency of both systems remains as an effect of the coupling between them. This effect has been discussed e.g. in \cite{koch_charge-insensitive_2007} and yields an effective Hamiltonian of the form
%
\begin{equation}
\hat{H}_{eff} = \frac{\hbar\omega_{01}'}{2}\hat{\sigma}_z+(\hbar\omega_r'+\hbar \chi \hat{\sigma}_z)\hat{a}^\dagger \hat{a}
\end{equation}
%
Here, the resonance frequencies of the qubit and the resonator are shifted as $\omega_{01}'=\omega_{01}+\chi_{01}$ and $\omega_r' = \omega_{r}-\chi_{12}/2$ and the dispersive shift is given as $\chi=\chi_{01}-\chi_{12}/2$, where $\chi_{ij}=g_{ij}^2/(\omega_{ij}-\omega_r)$. As can be seen, for a state with $n$ photons, the energy difference between the two qubit levels is given as
%
\begin{equation}
\omega_{01}^n = \omega_{01}'+2\chi n
\end{equation}
%
Thus, there is a dispersive shift of the qubit transition frequency that is proportional to the number of photons in the resonator. Likewise, the resonance frequency of the resonator gets also shifted by $2\chi$ depending on the state of the qubit. The latter effect is very useful since it allows us to read out the state of the qubit by measuring the state-dependent frequency displacement of the resonator, as will be explained later.
\subsection{Qubit-Qubit Interaction}

In this section we will discuss possible qubit-qubit coupling schemes. We will regard a direct coupling scheme involving a capacitive coupling between two qubits and an indirect scheme involving the coupling of multiple qubits to a resonator which acts as a ``quantum bus''.

\subsubsection{Coupling Bus}

Blais {\it et. al.} \citep{blais_quantum-information_2007} showed that extending the single-qubit rotating-wave Hamiltonian as given in eq. (\ref{eq:cqed_rotating_wave}) to the case of two qubits yields an effective qubit-qubit coupling Hamiltonian of the form
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{H}_{2q} & = & \hbar\frac{g_1 g_2(\Delta_1+\Delta_2)}{2\Delta_1\Delta_2}(\sigma_1^+\sigma_2^-+\sigma_1^-\sigma_2^+) \label{eq:cqed_bus_coupling}
\end{eqnarray}
%
This approximation is valid in the limit of large qubit-resonator detuning where $\Delta_1 \gg g_1,\Delta_2 \gg g_2$. Here $\Delta_{1,2} = \omega_{01}^{1,2}-\omega_r$ is the detuning of the $\ket{0}\to\ket{1}$ transition frequency of each qubit to the bus resonator. Full energy-exchange between the qubits is achieved when the qubit frequencies are in resonance. By detuning the qubits from the resonator, the effective coupling constant can be varied, which is advantageous in many settings. 

\subsubsection{Direct Capacitive Coupling}

A direct capacitive coupling $C_{qq}$ between two qubits yields a coupling Hamiltonian of the form
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{H}_{qq} & = & \frac{1}{2}C_{qq}\hat{V}_{qq}^2 = \frac{1}{2}C_{qq}\left[\frac{2e}{C_{\Sigma 1}}(n_{g1}-\hat{n}_1)-\frac{2e}{C_{\Sigma 2}}(n_{g2}-\hat{n}_2)\right]^2 \\
& = & \frac{4e^2 C_{qq}}{C_{\Sigma 1}C_{\Sigma_2}}\hat{n}_1\hat{n}_2+\hdots \label{eq:cqed_capacitive_coupling}
\end{eqnarray}
%
This equation is valid in the limit where $C_{qq} \ll C_{\Sigma 1},C_{\Sigma 2}$, otherwise the coupling gets renormalized by a factor $\alpha = 1/(1-C_{qq}^2/[C_{\Sigma 1}C_{\Sigma 2}])$ \citep{nguyen_cooper_2008}. Rewriting it in the basis of uncoupled qubit states yields the effective Hamiltonian
%
\begin{equation}
\hat{H}_{qq} = \hbar 2 g_{qq}\left(\sigma^+_1\sigma^-_2+\sigma^-_1\sigma^+_2\right) \label{eq:cqed_qubit_interaction_hamiltonian}
\end{equation}
%
where we have defined the effective qubit-qubit coupling as $\hbar g_{qq} = 2e^2 C_{qq}/C_{\Sigma 1}C_{\Sigma 2}$. Full energy exchange between the qubits is achieved when the qubit frequencies are in resonance. For the more general case of two coupled n-level Transmons, the coupling Hamiltonian takes a slightly more complicated form, as discusses in the Appendix of this thesis. Directly coupling two qubits can be advantageous since it simplifies the circuit layout and does not require an auxiliary quantum system. However, since the coupling is always turned on it is difficult to achieve a sufficiently good ON/OFF ratio that is needed for many applications (e.g. to realize a quantum gate).

\section{The Josephson Bifurcation Amplifier}

\begin{SCfigure}[1][ht!]

	\label{fig:jba_schematic}
\end{SCfigure}

In this section we will  discuss the physics of superconducting nonlinear bifurcation amplifiers, which we use to realize a single-shot readout scheme for our qubits. Most notably, we will discuss the so-called {\it Josephson bifurcation amplifier (JBA)} and the so-called {\it cavity Josephson bifurcation amplifier (CJBA)}, as shown in fig. \ref{fig:jba_schematic}. The JBA typically consists of a Josephson junction in parallel with a capacitor and (optionally) an inductor. The CJBA, on the other hand, consists of a transmission line resonator with a Josephson junction embedded in its central conductor. As shown before, a transmission line resonator can be treated mathematically as a lumped elements resonator, hence the physics of the CJBA can be mapped to that of the JBA. We will therefore restrict the following discussion in this section to the JBA, noting that the results can be easily applied to the CJBA as well. A more detailed comparision between the JBA and CJBA can be found e.g. in \cite{palacios-laloy_superconducting_2010}. For illustration, fig. \ref{fig:cba_schematic} shows the CJBA readout that we use for our two-qubit experiments.

	\label{fig:cba_schematic}
\end{SCfigure}

The circuit in fig. \ref{fig:jba_schematic}b can be modeled as
%
\begin{equation}
[L_e+L_J (i)]\ddot{q}+R_e \dot{q}+\frac{q}{C_e} = V_e \cos{\left(\omega_m t\right)}
\end{equation}
%
Here, $L_J$ the Josephson inductance as given by eq. (\ref{eq:josephson_inductance}) and $L_e$, $C_e$ and $R_e$ are the resistance, inductance and capacitance in series to the Josephson junction in the circuit. $V_e$ is the amplitude of the driving voltage, which oscillates at a frequency $\omega_m$. Expanding the Josephson inductance in this equation to second order leads to the equation
%
\begin{equation}
\left(L_e+L_J\left[1+\frac{\dot{q}^2}{2 I_0^2}\right]\right)\ddot{q}+R_e \dot{q}+\frac{q}{C_e} = V_e \cos{\left( \omega_m t\right)}
\end{equation}
%
Defining the total inductance $L_t = L_e+L_J$, the participation ratio $p=L_J/L_t$, the resonance frequency $\omega_r = 1/\sqrt{L_t C_e}$ and the quality factor $Q = \omega_r L_t / R_e$ we can rewrite this as

\begin{equation}
\ddot{q}+\frac{\omega_r}{Q}\dot{q}+\omega_r^2 q + \frac{p \dot{q}^2 \ddot{q}}{2 I_0} = \frac{V_e}{L_t}\cos{\left(\omega_m t \right)}
\end{equation}

Introducing the reduced variables $\beta = (V_e/\phi_0 \omega_m)^2(pQ/2\Omega)^3$, $\Delta_m = \omega_r-\omega_m$, $\tau = t\Delta_m$, $\Omega=2Q\Delta_m/\omega_r$ and $u(t) = \sqrt{pQ/2\Omega}\cdot q(t)\omega_m/I_0$ we can further rewrite this equation to obtain
%
\begin{align}
\frac{\Delta_m}{\omega_m}\ddot{u}+\left(\frac{1}{Q \omega_m}+2i\right)\dot{u} \notag \\
 + \left[ 2\left(\frac{\omega_r^2-\omega_m^2}{2\omega_m \Delta_m}\right)+\frac{1}{Q\Delta m}-2|u|^2\right]u & =  2\sqrt{\beta} \label{eq:jba_theory_1}
\end{align}
%
where $\dot{u}=du/d\tau$. In the limit where $Q \gg 1$, $\Delta_m\omega_m \ll 1$ such that $\omega_m+\omega_r \approx 2\omega_m$ and $\ddot{u}\ll\omega_m \dot{u}$ we can simplify this equation to obtain
%
\begin{equation}
\dot{u} = -\frac{u}{\Omega}-iu\left(|u|^2-1\right)-i\sqrt{\beta} \label{eq:jba_reduced_equation}
\end{equation}
%
The stationary solutions of this equation, corresponding to steady-state oscillations, are given as
%
\begin{equation}
\frac{|u|^2}{\Omega^2}+|u|^2\left(|u|^2-1\right)^2 = \beta(\Omega)
\end{equation}
%
This equation can have one or two stable solutions, depending on the parameter $\beta(\Omega)$. The region where multiple solutions exist is usually called the {\it bistability region} and is limited by the the two parameter boundaries
%
\begin{equation}
\beta^\pm(\Omega) = \frac{2}{27}\left[1+\left(\frac{3}{\Omega}\right)^2\pm\left(1-\frac{3}{\Omega^2}\right)^{3/2}\right] \label{eq:jba_beta}
\end{equation}
%
Fig. \ref{fig:jba_curves} shows the values of $\beta^\pm(\Omega)$ as well as the phase $\phi\simeq \mathrm{arg}(u(t))$ and the amplitude $\sqrt{B}\propto A \simeq |u(t)|$ of different stable solutions of eq. (\ref{eq:jba_reduced_equation}) for a JBA with $\alpha=0.05$ and $\gamma=0.01$, where $\alpha=V_ep^{3/2}/\phi_0 \omega_r$ and $\gamma = R_e/L_t\omega_r$ characterize the drive strength and dissipation in the JBA, respectively. In chapter \ref{chapter:processor_characterization} we will show how to use the bistable behavior of the CJBA to construct a single-shot qubit readout.

(\ref{eq:jba_reduced_equation}) for the JBA parameters $\alpha=0.05$ and $\gamma=0.01$. In the hysteretic region, three solutions exists, two of which are stable. The solution realized at a given moment depends thus on the history of the system, allowing for hysteretic behaviour.}
